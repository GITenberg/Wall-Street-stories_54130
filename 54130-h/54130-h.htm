  <h2 class='c005'>THE WOMAN AND HER BONDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>It seemed to Fullerton F. Colwell, of the famous
Stock-Exchange house of Wilson &amp; Graves, that
he had done his full duty by his friend Harry
Hunt. He was a director in a half score of companies—financial
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutantes</span></i> which his firm had
“brought out” and over whose stock-market destinies
he presided. His partners left a great deal
to him, and even the clerks in the office ungrudgingly
acknowledged that Mr. Colwell was “the
hardest worked man in the place, barring none”—an
admission that means much to those who know
it is always the downtrodden clerks who do all the
work and their employers who take all the profit
and credit. Possibly the important young men
who did all the work in Wilson &amp; Graves’ office
bore witness to Mr. Colwell’s industry so cheerfully,
because Mr. Colwell was ever inquiring, very
courteously, and, above all, sympathetically, into
the amount of work each man had to perform, and
suggesting, the next moment, that the laborious
amount in question was indisputably excessive.
Also, it was he who raised salaries; wherefore he
was the most charming as well as the busiest man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>there. Of his partners, John G. Wilson was a
consumptive, forever going from one health resort
to another, devoting his millions to the purchase
of railroad tickets in the hope of out-racing Death.
George B. Graves was a dyspeptic, nervous, irritable,
and, to boot, penurious; a man whose chief
recommendation at the time Wilson formed the
firm had been his cheerful willingness to do all the
dirty work. Frederick R. Denton was busy in the
“Board Room”—the Stock Exchange—all day,
executing orders, keeping watch over the market
behavior of the stocks with which the firm was
identified, and from time to time hearing things
not meant for his ears, being the truth regarding
Wilson &amp; Graves. But Fullerton F. Colwell had
to do everything—in the stock market and in the
office. He conducted the manipulation of the
Wilson &amp; Graves stocks, took charge of the un-nefarious
part of the numerous pools formed by
the firm’s customers—Mr. Graves attending to the
other details—and had a hand in the actual management
of various corporations. Also, he conferred
with a dozen people daily—chiefly “big
people,” in Wall Street parlance—who were about
to “put through” stock-market “deals.” He
had devoted his time, which was worth thousands,
and his brain, which was worth millions, to disentangling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>his careless friend’s affairs, and when it
was all over and every claim adjusted, and he had
refused the executor’s fees to which he was entitled,
it was found that poor Harry Hunt’s estate
not only was free from debt, but consisted of
$38,000 in cash, deposited in the Trolleyman’s
Trust Company, subject to Mrs. Hunt’s order, and
drawing interest at the rate of 2½ per cent per
annum. He had done his work wonderfully well,
and, in addition to the cash, the widow owned an
unencumbered house Harry had given her in his
lifetime.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long after the settlement of the estate Mrs.
Hunt called at his office. It was a very busy day.
The bears were misbehaving—and misbehaving
mighty successfully. Alabama Coal &amp; Iron—the
firm’s great specialty—was under heavy fire from
“Sam” Sharpe’s Long Tom as well as from the
room-traders’ Maxims. All that Colwell could
do was to instruct Denton, who was on the ground,
to “support” <em>Ala. C. &amp; I.</em> sufficiently to discourage
the enemy, and not enough to acquire the
company’s entire capital stock. He was himself
at that moment practising that peculiar form of
financial dissimulation which amounts to singing
blithely at the top of your voice when your beloved
sackful of gold has been ripped by bear-paws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>and the coins are pouring out through the
rent. Every quotation was of importance; a half
inch of tape might contain an epic of disaster. It
was not wise to fail to read every printed character.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mr. Colwell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He ceased to pass the tape through his fingers,
and turned quickly, almost apprehensively, for a
woman’s voice was not heard with pleasure at an
hour of the day when distractions were undesirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, good morning, Mrs. Hunt,” he said, very
politely. “I am very glad indeed to see you.
And how do you do?” He shook hands, and led
her, a bit ceremoniously, to a huge armchair.
His manners endeared him even to the big Wall
Street operators, who were chiefly interested in the
terse speech of the ticker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course, you are very well, Mrs. Hunt.
Don’t tell me you are not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye-es,” hesitatingly. “As well as I can hope
to be since—since——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Time alone, dear Mrs. Hunt, can help us.
You must be very brave. It is what he would
have liked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I know,” she sighed. “I suppose I
must.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>There was a silence. He stood by, deferentially
sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Ticky-ticky-ticky-tick</em>,” said the ticker.</p>

<p class='c000'>What did it mean, in figures? Reduced to
dollars and cents, what did the last three brassy
taps say? Perhaps the bears were storming the
Alabama Coal &amp; Iron intrenchments of “scaled
buying orders”; perhaps Colwell’s trusted lieutenant,
Fred Denton, had repulsed the enemy.
Who was winning? A spasm, as of pain, passed
over Mr. Fullerton F. Colwell’s grave face. But
the next moment he said to her, slightly conscience-strickenly,
as if he reproached himself for
thinking of the stock market in her presence:
“You must not permit yourself to brood, Mrs.
Hunt. You know what I thought of Harry, and
I need not tell you how glad I shall be to do what
I may, for his sake, Mrs. Hunt, and for your own.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Ticky-ticky-ticky-tick!</em>” repeated the ticker.</p>

<p class='c000'>To avoid listening to the voluble little machine,
he went on: “Believe me, Mrs. Hunt, I
shall be only too glad to serve you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are so kind, Mr. Colwell,” murmured
the widow; and after a pause: “I came to see
you about that money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They tell me in the trust company that if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>leave the money there without touching it I’ll
make $79 a month.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me see; yes; that is about what you may
expect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Mr. Colwell, I can’t live on that.
Willie’s school costs me $50, and then there’s
Edith’s clothes,” she went on, with an air which
implied that as for herself she wouldn’t care at all.
“You see, he was so indulgent, and they are
used to so much. Of course, it’s a blessing we
have the house; but taxes take up so much; and—isn’t
there some way of investing the money so
it could bring more?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I might buy some bonds for you. But for
your principal to be absolutely safe at all times,
you will have to invest in very high-grade securities,
which will return to you about 3½ per cent.
That would mean, let’s see, $110 a month.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Harry spent $10,000 a year,” she
murmured, complainingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Harry was always—er—rather extravagant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I’m glad he enjoyed himself while he
lived,” she said, quickly. Then, after a pause:
“And, Mr. Colwell, if I should get tired of the
bonds, could I always get my money back?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You could always find a ready market for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>them. You might sell them for a little more or
for a little less than you paid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shouldn’t like to sell them,” she said, with a
business air, “for less than I paid. What would
be the sense?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right, Mrs. Hunt,” he said, encouragingly.
“It wouldn’t be very profitable, would it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Ticky-ticky-ticky-ticky-ticky-ticky-tick!</em>” said
the ticker. It was whirring away at a furious
rate. Its story is always interesting when it is
busy. And Colwell had not looked at the tape
in fully five minutes!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Couldn’t you buy something for me, Mr. Colwell,
that when I came to sell it I could get more
than it cost me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No man can guarantee that, Mrs. Hunt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shouldn’t like to lose the little I have,” she
said, hastily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, there is no danger of that. If you will
give me a check for $35,000, leaving $3,000 with
the trust company for emergencies, I shall buy
some bonds which I feel reasonably certain will
advance in price within a few months.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Ticky-ticky-ticky-tick</em>,” interrupted the ticker.
In some inexplicable way it seemed to him that
the brassy sound had an ominous ring, so he
added: “But you will have to let me know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>promptly, Mrs. Hunt. The stock market, you
see, is not a polite institution. It waits for none,
not even for your sex.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gracious me, must I take the money out of
the bank to-day and bring it to you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A check will do.” He began to drum on the
desk nervously with his fingers, but ceased
abruptly as he became aware of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, I’ll send it to you to-day. I know
you’re very busy, so I won’t keep you any longer.
And you’ll buy good, cheap bonds for me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Mrs. Hunt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s no danger of losing, is there, Mr.
Colwell?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None whatever. I have bought some for
Mrs. Colwell, and I would not run the slightest
risk. You need have no fear about them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s exceedingly kind of you, Mr. Colwell.
I am more grateful than I can say. I—I——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The way to please me is not to mention it,
Mrs. Hunt. I am going to try to make some
money for you, so that you can at least double
the income from the trust company.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thanks, ever so much. Of course, I know
you are thoroughly familiar with such things.
But I’ve heard so much about the money everybody
loses in Wall Street that I was half afraid.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Not when you buy good bonds, Mrs. Hunt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mr. Colwell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mrs. Hunt. Remember, whenever
I may be of service you are to let me know
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, thank you, so much, Mr. Colwell. Good
morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mrs. Hunt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Hunt sent him a check for $35,000, and
Colwell bought 100 five-per cent gold bonds of
the Manhattan Electric Light, Heat &amp; Power
Company, paying 96 for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These bonds,” he wrote to her, “will surely
advance in price, and when they touch a good
figure I shall sell a part, and keep the balance for
you as an investment. The operation is partly
speculative, but I assure you the money is safe.
You will have an opportunity to increase your
original capital and your entire funds will then be
invested in these same bonds—Manhattan Electric
5s—as many as the money will buy. I hope
within six months to secure for you an income of
twice as much as you have been receiving from
the trust company.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning she called at his office.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mrs. Hunt. I trust you are
well.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Good morning, Mr. Colwell. I know I am
an awful bother to you, but——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are greatly mistaken, Mrs. Hunt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very kind. You see, I don’t exactly
understand about those bonds. I thought you
could tell me. I’m so stupid,” archly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I won’t have you prevaricate about yourself,
Mrs. Hunt. Now, you gave me $35,000, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.” Her tone indicated that she granted
that much and nothing more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I opened an account for you with our
firm. You were credited with the amount. I
then gave an order to buy one hundred bonds of
$1,000 each. We paid 96 for them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t follow you quite, Mr. Colwell. I told
you”—another arch smile—“I was so stupid!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It means that for each $1,000–bond $960
was paid. It brought the total up to $96,000.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I only had $35,000 to begin with. You
don’t mean I’ve made that much, do you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not yet, Mrs. Hunt. You put in $35,000;
that was your margin, you know; and we put in
the other $61,000 and kept the bonds as security.
We owe you $35,000, and you owe us $61,000,
and——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—I know you’ll laugh at me, Mr. Colwell—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>I really can’t help thinking it’s something
like the poor people you read about, who
mortgage their houses, and they go on, and the
first thing you know some real-estate agent owns
the house and you have nothing. I have a friend,
Mrs. Stilwell, who lost hers that way,” she finished,
corroboratively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is not a similar case, exactly. The reason
why you use a margin is that you can do
much more with the money that way than if you
bought outright. It protects your broker against
a depreciation in the security purchased, which is
all he wants. In this case you theoretically owe
us $61,000, but the bonds are in your name, and
they are worth $96,000, so that if you want to
pay us back, all you have to do is to order us to
sell the bonds, return the money we have advanced,
and keep the balance of your margin; that is, of
your original sum.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t understand why I should owe the
firm. I shouldn’t mind so much owing you, because
I know you’d never take advantage of my
ignorance of business matters. But I’ve never
met Mr. Wilson nor Mr. Graves. I don’t even
know how they look.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you know me,” said Mr. Colwell, with
patient courtesy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Oh, it isn’t that I’m afraid of being cheated,
Mr. Colwell,” she said hastily and reassuringly;
“but I don’t wish to be under obligations to any
one, particularly utter strangers; though, of
course, if you say it is all right, I am satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear Mrs. Hunt, don’t worry about this
matter. We bought these bonds at 96. If the
price should advance to 110, as I think it will,
then you can sell three fifths for $66,000, pay us
back $61,000, and keep $5,000 for emergencies
in savings banks drawing 4 per cent interest, and
have in addition 40 bonds which will pay you
$2,000 a year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That would be lovely. And the bonds are
now 96?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; you will always find the price in the
financial page of the newspapers, where it says
BONDS. Look for <em>Man. Elec. 5s</em>,” and he
showed her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, thanks, ever so much. Of course, I am
a great bother, I know——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are nothing of the kind, Mrs. Hunt.
I’m only too glad to be of the slightest use to
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Colwell, busy with several important
deals, did not follow closely the fluctuations in
the price of Manhattan Electric Light, Heat &amp;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Power Company 5s. The fact that there had
been any change at all was made clear to him by
Mrs. Hunt. She called a few days after her first
visit, with perturbation written large on her face.
Also, she wore the semi-resolute look of a person
who expects to hear unacceptable excuses.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mr. Colwell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you do, Mrs. Hunt? Well, I
hope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I am well enough. I wish I could say as
much for my financial matters.” She had acquired
the phrase from the financial reports which
she had taken to reading religiously every day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, how is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are 95 now,” she said, a trifle accusingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who are <em>they</em>, pray, Mrs. Hunt?” in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The bonds. I saw it in last night’s paper.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Colwell smiled. Mrs. Hunt almost became
indignant at his levity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t let that worry you, Mrs. Hunt. The
bonds are all right. The market is a trifle dull;
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A friend,” she said, very slowly, “who knows
all about Wall Street, told me last night that it
made a difference of $1,000 to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“So it does, in a way; that is, if you tried to
sell your bonds. But as you are not going to do
so until they show you a handsome profit, you
need not worry. Don’t be concerned about the
matter, I beg of you. When the time comes for
you to sell the bonds I’ll let you know. Never
mind if the price goes off a point or two. You
are amply protected. Even if there should be a
panic I’ll see that you are not sold out, no matter
how low the price goes. You are not to worry
about it; in fact, you are not to think about it
at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, thanks, ever so much, Mr. Colwell. I didn’t
sleep a wink last night. But I knew——”</p>

<p class='c000'>A clerk came in with some stock certificates
and stopped short. He wanted Mr. Colwell’s
signature in a hurry, and at the same time dared
not interrupt. Mrs. Hunt thereupon rose and
said: “Well, I won’t take up any more of your
time. Good morning, Mr. Colwell. Thanks ever
so much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t mention it, Mrs. Hunt. Good morning.
You are going to do very well with those
bonds if you only have patience.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I’ll be patient now that I know all about
it; yes, indeed. And I hope your prophecy will
be fulfilled. Good morning, Mr. Colwell.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Little by little the bonds continued to decline.
The syndicate in charge was not ready to move
them. But Mrs. Hunt’s unnamed friend—her
Cousin Emily’s husband—who was employed in
an up-town bank, did not know all the particulars
of that deal. He knew the Street in the abstract,
and had accordingly implanted the seed of
insomnia in her quaking soul. Then, as he saw
values decline, he did his best to make the seed
grow, fertilizing a naturally rich soil with ominous
hints and headshakings and with phrases
that made her firmly believe he was gradually and
considerately preparing her for the worst. On the
third day of her agony Mrs. Hunt walked into
Colwell’s office. Her face was pale and she looked
distressed. Mr. Colwell sighed involuntarily—a
scarcely perceptible and not very impolite sigh—and
said: “Good morning, Mrs. Hunt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She nodded gravely and, with a little gasp, said,
tremulously: “The bonds!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes? What about them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She gasped again, and said: “The p-p-papers!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean, Mrs. Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She dropped into a chair nervelessly, as if exhausted.
After a pause she said: “It’s in all the
papers. I thought the <cite>Herald</cite> might be mistaken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>so I bought the <cite>Tribune</cite> and the <cite>Times</cite> and the
<cite>Sun</cite>. But no. It was the same in all. It was,”
she added, tragically, “93!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes?” he said, smilingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The smile did not reassure her; it irritated her
and aroused her suspicions. By him, of all men,
should her insomnia be deemed no laughing
matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Doesn’t that mean a loss of $3,000?” she
asked. There was a deny-it-if-you-dare inflection
in her voice of which she was not conscious. Her
cousin’s husband had been a careful gardener.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, because you are not going to sell your
bonds at 93, but at 110, or thereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if I did want to sell the bonds now,
wouldn’t I lose $3,000?” she queried, challengingly.
Then she hastened to answer herself:
“Of course I would, Mr. Colwell. Even I can
tell that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You certainly would, Mrs. Hunt; but——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew I was right,” with irrepressible
triumph.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you are not going to sell the bonds.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course, I don’t want to, because I can’t
afford to lose any money, much less $3,000. But
I don’t see how I can help losing it. I was
warned from the first,” she said, as if that made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>it worse. “I certainly had no business to risk
my all.” She had waived the right to blame some
one else, and there was something consciously just
and judicial about her attitude that was eloquent.
Mr. Colwell was moved by it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can have your money back, Mrs. Hunt,
if you wish it,” he told her, quite unprofessionally.
“You seem to worry about it so much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I am not worrying, exactly; only, I do
wish I hadn’t bought—I mean, the money was so
safe in the Trolleyman’s Trust Company, that I
can’t help thinking I might just as well have
let it stay where it was, even if it didn’t bring me
in so much. But, of course, if you want me to
leave it here,” she said, very slowly to give him
every opportunity to contradict her, “of course,
I’ll do just as you say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear Mrs. Hunt,” Colwell said, very politely,
“my only desire is to please you and to help
you. When you buy bonds you must be prepared
to be patient. It may take months before you
will be able to sell yours at a profit, and I don’t
know how low the price will go in the meantime.
Nobody can tell you that, because nobody knows.
But it need make no difference to you whether
the bonds go to 90, or even to 85, which is unlikely.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Why, how can you say so, Mr. Colwell? If
the bonds go to 90, I’ll lose $6,000–-my friend
said it was one thousand for every number down.
And at 85 that would be”—counting on her
fingers—“eleven numbers, that is, <em>eleven—thousand—dollars</em>!”
And she gazed at him, awe-strickenly,
reproachfully. “How <em>can</em> you say it
would make no difference, Mr. Colwell?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Colwell fiercely hated the unnamed “friend,”
who had told her so little and yet so much. But
he said to her, mildly: “I thought that I had explained
all that to you. It might hurt a weak
speculator if the bonds declined ten points, though
such a decline is utterly improbable. But it won’t
affect you in the slightest, since, having an ample
margin, you would not be forced to sell. You
would simply hold on until the price rose again.
Let me illustrate. Supposing your house cost
$10,000, and——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Harry paid $32,000,” she said, correctingly.
On second thought she smiled, in order to let
him see that she knew her interpolation was irrelevant.
But he might as well know the actual
cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” he said, good-humoredly, “we’ll
say $32,000, which was also the price of every
other house in that block. And suppose that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>owing to some accident, or for any reason whatever,
nobody could be found to pay more than
$25,000 for one of the houses, and three or four
of your neighbors sold theirs at that price. But
you wouldn’t, because you knew that in the fall,
when everybody came back to town, you would
find plenty of people who’d give you $50,000 for
your house; you wouldn’t sell it for $25,000, and
you wouldn’t worry. Would you, now?” he finished,
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” she said slowly. “I wouldn’t worry.
But,” hesitatingly, for, after all, she felt the awkwardness
of her position, “I wish I had the money
instead of the bonds.” And she added, self-defensively:
“I haven’t slept a wink for three nights
thinking about this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The thought of his coming emancipation cheered
Mr. Colwell immensely. “Your wish shall be
gratified, Mrs. Hunt. Why didn’t you ask me
before, if you felt that way?” he said, in mild reproach.
And he summoned a clerk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Make out a check for $35,000 payable to
Mrs. Rose Hunt, and transfer the 100 Manhattan
Electric Light 5s to my personal account.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave her the check and told her: “Here is
the money. I am very sorry that I unwittingly
caused you some anxiety. But all’s well that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>ends well. Any time that I can be of service to
you—Not at all. Don’t thank me, please; no.
Good morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But he did not tell her that by taking over her
account he paid $96,000 for bonds he could have
bought in the open market for $93,000. He was
the politest man in Wall Street; and, after all,
he had known Hunt for many years.</p>

<p class='c000'>A week later Manhattan Electric 5–per cent
bonds sold at 96 again. Mrs. Hunt called on
him. It was noon, and she evidently had spent
the morning mustering up courage for the visit.
They greeted one another, she embarrassed and
he courteous and kindly as usual.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Colwell, you still have those bonds, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I—I think I’d like to take them back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly, Mrs. Hunt. I’ll find out how much
they are selling for.” He summoned a clerk to
get a quotation on Manhattan Electric 5s. The
clerk telephoned to one of their bond-specialists,
and learned that the bonds could be bought at
96½. He reported to Mr. Colwell, and Mr. Colwell
told Mrs. Hunt, adding: “So you see they
are practically where they were when you bought
them before.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>She hesitated. “I—I—didn’t you buy them
from me at 93? I’d like to buy them back at
the same price I sold them to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, Mrs. Hunt,” he said; “I bought them
from you at 96.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the price was 93.” And she added, corroboratively:
“Don’t you remember it was in all
the papers?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, but I gave you back exactly the same
amount that I received from you, and I had the
bonds transferred to my account. They stand on
our books as having cost me 96.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But couldn’t you let me have them at 93?”
she persisted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m very sorry, Mrs. Hunt, but I don’t see
how I could. If you buy them in the open
market now, you will be in exactly the same
position as before you sold them, and you will
make a great deal of money, because they are
going up now. Let me buy them for you
at 96½.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“At 93, you mean,” with a tentative smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At whatever price they may be selling for,”
he corrected, patiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did you let me sell them, Mr. Colwell?”
she asked, plaintively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, my dear madam, if you buy them now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>you will be no worse off than if you had kept
the original lot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I don’t see why it is that I have to pay
96½ now for the very same bonds I sold last Tuesday
at 93. If it was some other bonds,” she added,
“I wouldn’t mind so much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear Mrs. Hunt, it makes no difference
which bonds you hold. They have all risen in
price, yours and mine and everybody’s; your lot
was the same as any other lot. You see that,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye-es; but——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, then, you are exactly where you were
before you bought any. You’ve lost nothing,
because you received your money back intact.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m willing to buy them,” she said resolutely,
“at 93.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Hunt, I wish I could buy them for you
at that price. But there are none for sale cheaper
than 96½.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, why did I let you sell my bonds!” she said,
disconsolately.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you worried so much because they had
declined that——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, but I didn’t know anything about business
matters. You know I didn’t, Mr. Colwell,”
she finished, accusingly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>He smiled in his good-natured way. “Shall I
buy the bonds for you?” he asked. He knew the
plans of the syndicate in charge, and being sure
the bonds would advance, he thought she might
as well share in the profits. At heart he felt
sorry for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She smiled back. “Yes,” she told him, “at
93.” It did not seem right to her, notwithstanding
his explanations, that she should pay 96½ for
them, when the price a few days ago was 93.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how can I, if they are 96½?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Colwell, it is 93 or nothing.” She was
almost pale at her own boldness. It really seemed
to her as if the price had only been waiting for her
to sell out in order to advance. And though she
wanted the bonds, she did not feel like yielding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I very much fear it will have to be
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Er—good morning, Mr. Colwell,” on the verge
of tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mrs. Hunt.” And before he
knew it, forgetting all that had gone before, he
added: “Should you change your mind, I should
be glad to——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know I wouldn’t pay more than 93 if I lived
to be a thousand years.” She looked expectantly
at him, to see if he had repented, and she smiled—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>smile that is a woman’s last resort, that
says, almost articulately: “I know you will, of
course, do as I ask. My question is only a formality.
I know your nobility, and I fear not.”
But he only bowed her out, very politely.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the Stock Exchange the price of <em>Man. Elec.
L. H. &amp; P. Co. 5s</em> rose steadily. Mrs. Hunt, too
indignant to feel lachrymose, discussed the subject
with her Cousin Emily and her husband. Emily
was very much interested. Between her and Mrs.
Hunt they forced the poor man to make strange
admissions, and, deliberately ignoring his feeble
protests, they worked themselves up to the point
of believing that, while it would be merely generous
of Mr. Colwell to let his friend’s widow have
the bonds at 93, it would be only his obvious duty
to let her have them at 96½. The moment they
reached this decision Mrs. Hunt knew how to act.
And the more she thought the more indignant she
became. The next morning she called on her late
husband’s executor and friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her face wore the look often seen on those
ardent souls who think their sacred and inalienable
rights have been trampled upon by the tyrant
Man, but who at the same time feel certain the
hour of retribution is near.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mr. Colwell. I came to find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>out exactly what you propose to do about my
bonds.” Her voice conveyed the impression that
she expected violent opposition, perhaps even bad
language, from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Mrs. Hunt. Why, what do
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>His affected ignorance deepened the lines on
her face. Instead of bluster he was using <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</span></i>!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think you ought to know, Mr. Colwell,” she
said, meaningly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I really don’t. I remember you wouldn’t
heed my advice when I told you not to sell out,
and again when I advised you to buy them
back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, at 96½,” she burst out, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, if you had, you would to-day have a
profit of over $7,000.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And whose fault is it that I haven’t?” She
paused for a reply. Receiving none, she went on:
“But never mind; I have decided to accept your
offer,” very bitterly, as if a poor widow could not
afford to be a chooser; “I’ll take those bonds at
96½.” And she added, under her breath: “Although
it really ought to be 93.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, Mrs. Hunt,” said Colwell, in measureless
astonishment, “you can’t do that, you know. You
wouldn’t buy them when I wanted you to, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>can’t buy them for you now at 96½. Really, you
ought to see that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cousin Emily and she had gone over a dozen
imaginary interviews with Mr. Colwell—of varying
degrees of storminess—the night before, and
they had, in an idle moment, and not because they
really expected it, represented Mr. Colwell as taking
that identical stand. Mrs. Hunt was, accordingly,
prepared to show both that she knew her moral
and technical rights, and that she was ready to
resist any attempt to ignore them. So she said,
in a voice so ferociously calm that it should have
warned any guilty man: “Mr. Colwell, will you
answer me one question?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand, Mrs. Hunt, with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; only one. Have you kept the bonds
that I bought, or have you not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What difference does that make, Mrs. Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He evaded the answer!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes or no, please. Have you, or have you
not, those same identical bonds?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; I have. But——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And to whom do those bonds belong, by
rights?” She was still pale, but resolute.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To me, certainly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To <em>you</em>, Mr. Colwell?” She smiled. And in
her smile were a thousand feelings; but not mirth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Yes, Mrs. Hunt, to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And do you propose to keep them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not even if I pay 96½ will you give them
to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Hunt,” Colwell said with warmth “when
I took those bonds off your hands at 93 it represented
a loss on paper of $3,000——”</p>

<p class='c000'>She smiled in pity—pity for his judgment in
thinking her so hopelessly stupid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And when you wanted me to sell them back
to you at 93 after they had risen to 96½, if I had
done as you wished, it would have meant an actual
loss of $3,000 to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again she smiled—the same smile, only the
pity was now mingled with rising indignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For Harry’s sake I was willing to pocket the
first loss, in order that you might not worry. But
I didn’t see why I should make you a present of
$3,000,” he said, very quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never asked you to do it,” she retorted, hotly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you had lost any money through my fault,
it would have been different. But you had your
original capital unimpaired. You had nothing to
lose, if you bought back the same bonds at practically
the same price. Now you come and ask me
to sell you the bonds at 96½ that are selling in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>market for 104, as a reward, I suppose, for your
refusal to take my advice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Colwell, you take advantage of my position
to insult me. And Harry trusted you so
much! But let me tell you that I am not going
to let you do just as you please. No doubt you
would like to have me go home and forget how
you’ve acted toward me. But I am going to consult
a lawyer, and see if I am to be treated this
way by a <em>friend</em> of my husband’s. You’ve made
a mistake, Mr. Colwell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, madam, I certainly have. And, in order
to avoid making any more, you will oblige me
greatly by never again calling at this office. By
all means consult a lawyer. Good morning,
madam,” said the politest man in Wall Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll see,” was all she said; and she left the
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colwell paced up and down his office nervously.
It was seldom that he allowed himself to lose his
temper, and he did not like it. The ticker
whirred away excitedly, and in an absent-minded,
half-disgusted way he glanced sideways at it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Man. Elec. 5s, 106⅛</em>,” he read on the tape.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE BREAK IN TURPENTINE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>In the beginning of the beginning the distillers of
turpentine carried competition to the quarrelling
point. Then they carried the quarrel to the point
of silence, which was most to be feared, for it
meant that no time was to be wasted in words.
All were losing money; but each hoped that the
others were losing more, proportionately, and therefore
would go under all the sooner. The survivors
thought they could manage to keep on surviving,
for on what twelve would starve four could
feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is seen periodically in the United States: an
industry apparently suffering from suicidal mania.
It is incomprehensible, inexplicable, though mediocrities
mutter: “Over-production!” and shake
their heads complacently, proud of having diagnosed
the trouble. Here was the turpentine business,
once great and lucrative, now ruin-producing;
formerly affording a comfortable livelihood to
many thousands and now giving ever-diminishing
wages to ever-diminishing numbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Mr. Alfred Neustadt, a banker in a famous
turpentine district, who first called his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>brother-in-law’s attention to the pitiable sight.
Mr. Jacob Greenbaum’s soul thrilled during Neustadt’s
recital. He perceived golden possibilities
that dazzled him: He decided to form a Turpentine
Trust.</p>

<p class='c000'>First he bought for a song all the bankrupt
stills; seven of them. Later on, in his scheme of
trust creation, these self-same distilleries would be
turned over to the “octopus,” at nice fat figures,
as Greenbaum put it, self-admiringly, to his
brother-in-law. Then he secured options on nine
others, the tired-unto-death plants. In this way
he was able to control “a large productive capacity”
at an expenditure positively marvellous—it
was so small. It was also in his brother-in-law’s
name. Then the banking house of Greenbaum,
Lazarus &amp; Co. stepped in, interested accomplices,
duped or coerced into selling enough other distillers
to assure success, cajoled the more stubborn,
wheedled the more credulous, gave way gracefully
to the shrewder and gathered them all into the
fold. The American Turpentine Company was
formed, with a capital stock of $30,000,000 or
300,000 shares at $100 each. The cash needed,
to pay Mr. Greenbaum, Neustadt and others who
sold their plants for “part cash and part stock,”
was provided by an issue of $25,000,000 of 6 per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>cent bonds, underwritten by a syndicate composed
of Greenbaum, Lazarus &amp; Co., I. &amp; S. Wechsler,
Morris Steinfelder’s Sons, Reis &amp; Stern, Kohn,
Fischel &amp; Co., Silberman &amp; Lindheim, Rosenthal,
Shaffran &amp; Co. and Zeman Bros.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were men who never “speculated”; sometimes
they “conducted financial operations.” They
had shears, not fleeces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prospectus of the “Trust” was a masterpiece
of persuasiveness and vagueness, of slim statistics
and alluring generalities. In due course of
time the public subscribed for the greater part of
the $25,000,000 of bonds, and both bonds and
stock were “listed” on the New York Stock Exchange—that
is, they were placed on the list of
securities which members may buy or sell on the
“floor” of the Exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tabularly expressed, the syndicate’s operations

<p class='c000'>These figures were not for publication. They
told the exact truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The public knew nothing of the company’s
earning capacity, save a few tentative figures from
the prospectus, which was a sort of financial gospel
according to Greenbaum, but which did not
create fanatical devotees among investors. The
stock, unlike the Kipling ship, had not found itself.
It was not market-proven, not seasoned; no
one knew how much dependence to put on it;
wherefore the banks would not take it as collateral
security on loans and wherefore the “speculative
community” (as the newspapers call the stock
gamblers) would not touch it, since in a pinch it
might prove utterly unvendible. It remained for
the syndicate to make a “market” for it, to develop
such a condition of affairs that anyone at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>any time could, without overmuch difficulty and
without causing over-great fluctuations, sell readily
American Turpentine Company stock. The syndicate
would have to earn its commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the manufacturers who had received stock
in part payment were told most impressively by
Mr. Greenbaum not to sell their holdings under
any circumstances at any price below $75 a share.
Not knowing Mr. Greenbaum, they readily and
solemnly promised to obey him. They even permitted
themselves to think, after talking to him,
that they would some day receive $80 per share
for all their holdings. This precluded any untimely
“unloading” by the only people outside
the syndicate that held any Turpentine stock at
all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Greenbaum took charge of the market conduct
of “Turp,” as the tape called the stock of
the American Turpentine Company. At first, the
price was marked up by means of “matched” orders—preconcerted
and therefore not bona fide
transactions. Mr. Greenbaum told one of his
brokers to sell 1,000 shares of “Turp” to another
of his brokers and shortly afterwards the second
broker sold the same 1,000 shares to a third, by
pre-arrangement—this being the matching process—with
the result that the tape recorded transactions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of 2,000 shares. After the “matching”
had gone on for some time, readers of the tape
were supposed to imagine that the stock was legitimately
active and strong—two facts which in
turn were supposed to whet the buying appetite.
It was against the rule of the Exchange to
“match” orders, but how could convictions be
secured?</p>

<p class='c000'>“Turp” began at 25 and as the syndicate had
all the stock in the market, it was easily manipulated
upward to 35. Every day, many thousands of
shares, according to the Stock Exchange’s official
records, “changed hands”—from Greenbaum’s
right to his left and back again—and the price
rose steadily. But something was absent. The
manipulation was not convincing. It did not
make the general public nibble. The only buyers
were the “room traders,” that is, the professional
stock gamblers who were members of the
Exchange and speculated for themselves exclusively;
and those customers of the commission
houses who, because they were bound to speculate
daily or die and because they studied the ticker-ribbon
so assiduously, were known by the generic
name of “tape-worms.” These gentry, in and out
of the Exchange, provided the tape in its curious
language foretold a rise, would buy anything—from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>capitalized impudence, as in the case of Back
Bay Gas, whose property was actually worth nil
and its capital stock was $100,000,000, up to
Government bonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, the room traders and the tape-worms
reasoned not illogically that the “Greenbaum
gang” had all the stock and that perforce the
“gang” had to find a market for it; and the only
way to do this was by a nice “bull” or upward
movement. When a stock rises and rises and
rises the newspapers are full of pleasant stories
about it and the lambs read but do not run away;
they buy on the assumption that, as the stock has
already risen ten points it may rise ten more.
This explains why they make so much money in
Wall Street—for the natives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greenbaum and his associates were exceptionally
shrewd business men, thoroughly familiar with
Wall Street and its methods, cautious yet bold,
far-seeing yet eminently of the day. They were
practical financiers. They marked up the price
of “Turp” ten points; but they could not arouse
public interest in it so that people would buy it.
Indeed, at the end of three weeks, during which
the “Street” had been flooded with impressive
advice, printed and spoken, to buy because the
price was going higher, all they had for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>trouble was more stock-–6,000 shares from Ira
D. Keep, a distiller, who sold out at 38 because
he needed the money; and they also were obliged
to buy back from the “room traders” at 35 and
36 and higher, the same stock the “gang” had
sold at 30 and 31 and 32 and 34. Then the
manipulators had to “support” the stock at the
higher level, that is, they had to keep it from declining,
which could be done only by continuous
buying. By doing this the public might imagine
there was considerable merit in a stock which was
in such good demand from intelligent people as
to remain firm, notwithstanding its previous substantial
rise. And if somebody wanted “Turp”
why shouldn’t the public want it? The public
generally asks itself that question. It is in the
nature of a nibble and rejoices the hearts of the
financial anglers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every attempt to sell “Turp” met with failure.
At length it was decided to allow the price to sink
back to an “invitingly low” level. It was done.
But still the invited public refused to buy. Efforts
to encourage a short interest to over-extend itself
unto “squeezable” proportions failed similarly.
The Street was afraid to go “short” of a stock
which was so closely held. The philosophy of
short selling is simple; it really amounts to betting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>that values will decline. A man who “sells
short” sells what he does not possess, but hopes
to buy, later on, at a lower price. But since he
must deliver what he sells he borrows it from
some one else, giving the lender ample security.
To “cover” or to “buy in” is to purchase stock
previously sold short. Obviously, it is unwise to
be short of a stock which is held by such a few
that it may be difficult to borrow it. To
“squeeze” shorts is to advance the price in order
to force “covering.” This is done when the
short interest is large enough to make it worth
while.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of the next few months, after a
series of injudicious fluctuations which gave to
“Turp” a bad name, even as Wall Street names
went, despite glowing accounts of the company’s
wonderful business and after distributing less than
35,000 shares, the members of the “Turpentine
Skindicate,” as it was popularly called, sorrowfully
acknowledged that, while they had skilfully
organized the trust and had done fairly well with
the bonds, they certainly were not howling successes
as manipulators. During the following
eight months they sold more stock. They spared
not the widow nor the orphan. They even
“stuck” their intimate friends. They had sold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>for something what had cost them nothing; it
was natural to wish to sell more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, manipulators of stocks are born, not
made. The art is most difficult, for stocks should
be manipulated in such wise that they will not
look manipulated. Anybody can buy stocks or can
sell them. But not every one can sell stocks and
at the same time convey the impression that
he is buying them, and that prices therefore must
inevitably go much higher. It requires boldness
and consummate judgment, knowledge of technical
stock-market conditions, infinite ingenuity
and mental agility, absolute familiarity with
human nature, a careful study of the curious
psychological phenomena of gambling and long
experience with the Wall Street public and with
the wonderful imagination of the American
people; to say nothing of knowing thoroughly
the various brokers to be employed, their capabilities,
limitations and personal temperaments;
also, their price.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adequate manipulative machinery, moreover,
can be perfected only with much toil and patience
and money. Professional Wall Street will always
tell you that “the tape tells the story.” The
little paper ribbon, therefore, must be made to
tell such stories as the manipulator desires should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>be told to the public; he must produce certain
effects which should preserve an appearance of
alluring spontaneity and, above all, of legitimacy
and candor; he must be a great artist in mendacity
and at the same time have the superb self-confidence
of a grizzly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several members of the syndicate had many of
these qualities, but none had them all. It was
decided to put “Turp” stock in the hands of
Samuel Wimbleton Sharpe, the best manipulator
Wall Street had ever known. “Jakey” Greenbaum
said he would conduct the negotiations
with the great plunger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sharpe was a financial free-lance, free-booter
and free-thinker. He had made his first fortune
in the mining camps of Arizona and finding that
field too narrow had come to New York, where he
could gamble to his heart’s content. He was all
the things that an ideal manipulator should be
and several more. He had arrived in New York
with a sneer on his lips and a loaded revolver in
his financial hands. The other “big operators”
looked at him in pained astonishment. “I carry
my weapons openly,” Sharpe told them, “and you
conceal your dirks. Don’t hurt yourselves trying
to look honest. I never turn my back on such as
you.” Of this encounter was born a hostility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>that never grew faint. Sharpe had nothing of
his own to unload on anyone else, no property to
overcapitalize and sell to an undiscriminating
public by means of artistic lies and his enemies
often did. So they called him a gambler, very
bitterly, and he called them philanthropists, very
cheerfully. If he thought a stock was unduly
high he sold it confidently, aggressively, stupendously.
If he thought a stock was too low he
bought it boldly, ready to take all the offerings
and bid for more. And once on the march, he
might be temporarily checked, be forced by the
enemy to halt for a day or a week or a month;
but inevitably he arrived. And such an arrival!</p>

<p class='c000'>And as a manipulator of stock-values he had no
equal. On the bull side he rushed a stock upward
so steadily, so boldly and brilliantly, but,
above all, so persuasively, that lesser gamblers almost
fought to be allowed to take it off his hands
at incredibly high prices. And when in the conduct
of one of his masterly bear campaigns he saw
fit to “hammer” the market, values melted away
as by magic—Satanic magic, the poor lambs
thought. All stocks looked “sick,” looked as
though prices would go much lower; murmurs of
worse things to come were in the air, vague, disquieting,
ruin-breeding. The atmosphere of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Street was supersaturated with apprehension, and
the black shadow of Panic brooded over the Stock
Exchange, chilling the little gamblers’ hearts, wiping
out the last of the little gamblers’ margins.
And even the presidents of the solid, conservative
banks studied the ticker uneasily in their offices.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greenbaum was promptly admitted to Sharpe’s
private office. It was a half-darkened room, the
windows having wire-screens, summer and winter,
in order that prying eyes across the street might not
see his visitors or his confidential brokers, whose
identity it was advisable should remain unknown
to the Street. He was walking up and down the
room, pausing from time to time to look at the
tape. The ticker is the only telescope the stock-market
general has; it tells him what his forces
are doing and how the enemy is meeting his attacks.
Every inch of the tape is so much ground;
every quotation represents so many shots.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was something feline in Sharpe’s stealthy,
soundless steps, in his mustaches, in the conformation
of his face—broad of forehead and triangulating
chin-ward. In his eyes, too, there was something
tigerish—unmelodramatically cold hearted
and coldly curious as they looked upon Mr. Jacob
Greenbaum. Unconsciously the unfanciful Trust-maker
asked himself whether Sharpe’s heart-beats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>were not ticker ticks, impassively indicating the
pulse of the stock-market.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hallo, Greenbaum.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you do, Mr. Sharpe?” quoth the
millionaire senior partner of the firm of Greenbaum,
Lazarus &amp; Co. “I hope you are well?”
He bent his head to one side, his eyes full of a
caressing scrutiny, as though to ascertain the exact
condition of Sharpe’s health. “Yes, you must
be. I haven’t seen you look so fine in a long
time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You didn’t come up here just to tell me this,
Greenbaum, did you? How’s your Turpentine?
Oh!”—with a long whistle—“I see. You want
me to go into it, hey?” And he laughed—a sort
of half-chuckle, half-snarl.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greenbaum looked at him admiringly; then,
with a tentative smile, he said: “I am discovered!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly every American may be met as an equal
on the field of Humor. To jest in business matters
of the greatest importance bespoke the national
trait. Moreover, if Sharpe declined, Greenbaum
could treat the entire affair—the proposal
and the rejection—as parts of a joke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” said Sharpe, unhumorously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter with a pool?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“How big?” coldly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Up to the limit.” Again the Trust-maker
smiled, uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You haven’t all the capital stock, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, call it 100,000 shares,” said Greenbaum,
more uncertainly and less jovially.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who is to be in it besides you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, you know; the same old crowd.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I know,” mimicked Mr. Sharpe, scornfully,
“the same old crowd. You ought to have come
to me before; it will take something to overcome
your own reputations. How much will each
take?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll fix that O. K. if you take hold,” answered
Greenbaum, laughingly. “We’ve got over
100,000 shares and we’d rather some one else held
some of it. We ain’t hogs. Ha! Ha!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, the distillers?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are in the pool. I’ve got most of their
stock in my office. I’ll see that it does not come
out until I say so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a pause. Between Sharpe’s eyebrows
were two deep lines. At length, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bring your friends here, this afternoon. Good-by,
Greenbaum. And, I say, Greenbaum.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No funny tricks at any stage of the game.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“What’s the use of saying such things, Mr.
Sharpe?” with an experimental frown.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The use is so you won’t try any. Come at
four,” and Mr. Sharpe began to pace up and down
the room. Greenbaum hesitated, still frowning
tentatively; but he said nothing and at length
went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sharpe looked at the tape. “Turp” was 29¼.</p>

<p class='c000'>He resumed his restless march back and forth.
It was only when the market “went against him”
that Mr. Sharpe did not pace about the room in
the mechanical way of a menagerie animal, glancing
everywhere but seeing nothing. When something
unexpected happened in the market Sharpe stood
immobile beside the ticker, because his overworked
nerves were tense—like a tiger into
whose cage there enters a strange and eatable
animal.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the minute of four there called on Mr.
Sharpe the senior partners of the firms of Greenbaum,
Lazarus &amp; Co., I. &amp; S. Wechsler, Morris

Co., Silberman &amp; Lindheim, Rosenthal, Shaffran
&amp; Co., and Zeman Bros.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were ushered not into the private office,
but into a sumptuously furnished room, the walls
of which were covered with dashing oil paintings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of horses and horse-races. The visitors seated
themselves about a long oaken table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sharpe appeared at the threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you do, gentlemen? Don’t move,
please; don’t move.” He made no motion to
shake hands with any of them, but Greenbaum
came to him and held out his fat dexter resolutely
and Sharpe took it. Then Greenbaum sat down
and said, “We’re here,” and smiled, blandly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sharpe stood at the head of the polished, shining
table, and glanced slowly down the double
row of alert faces. His look rested a fraction of
a minute on each man’s eyes—a sharp, half-contemptuous,
almost menacing look that made the
older men uncomfortable and the younger resentful.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Greenbaum tells me you wish to pool your
Turpentine stock and have me market it for
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All nodded; a few said “yes”; one—Lindheim,
<em>aetat 27</em>—said, flippantly, “That’s what.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. What will each man’s proportion
be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have a list here, Sharpe,” put in Greenbaum.
He intentionally omitted the “Mr.” for
effect upon his colleagues. Sharpe noted it, but
did not mind it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is that correct, gentlemen?” asked Sharpe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greenbaum nodded his head and smiled affably
as befitted the holder of the biggest block. Some
said “Yes”; others, “That is correct.” Young
Lindheim said, “That’s what.” The founders of
the firm—his uncle and his father—were dead,
and he had inherited the entire business from the
two. His flippancy was not inherited from either.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is understood,” said Sharpe, slowly, “that
I am to have complete charge of the pool, and
conduct operations as I see fit. I want no advice
and no questions. If there is any asking
to be done, I’ll do it. If my way does not suit
you we’ll call the deal off right here, because it’s
the only way I have. I know my business, and if
you know yours you’ll keep your mouths shut in
this office and out of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>No one said a word, not even Lindheim.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Each of you will continue to carry the stock
for which he has agreed to stand in the pool.
You’ve had it a year and couldn’t sell it, and you
might keep it a few weeks more, until I sell it for
you. It must be subject to my call at one
minute’s notice. I’ve looked into the company’s
business, and I think the stock can easily sell at
75 or 80.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something like a gasp of astonishment came
from those eight hardened speculators. Then
Greenbaum smiled, knowingly, as if that were his
programme, memorized and spoken by Sharpe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is also understood,” went on Sharpe, very
calmly, “that none of you has any other stock for
sale at any price, excepting his proportion in this
pool, and that proportion, of course, is not to be
sold excepting by me.” No one said a word, and
he continued:</p>

<p class='c000'>“My profit will be 25 per cent of the pool’s
winnings, figuring on the stock having been put
in at 29. The remaining profits will be divided
pro rata among you; the necessary expenses will
be shared similarly. I think that’s all. And,
gentlemen, no unloading on the sly—not one
share.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want you to understand, Mr. Sharpe, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>we are not in the habit of—” began Greenbaum
with perfunctory dignity. He felt it was his
duty to remonstrate before his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, that’s all right, Greenbaum. I know
you. That’s why I’m particular. We’ve all
been in Wall Street more than a month or two.
I simply said, ‘No shenanigan.’ And, Greenbaum,”
he added, very distinctly, while his eyes
took on that curious, cold, menacing look, “I
mean it, every d——d word of it. I want the
numbers of all your stock-certificates. Excuse
me, gentlemen. I am very busy. Good-afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And that is how the famous bull pool in
Turpentine came to be formed. They thought he
might have been nicer, more diplomatic; but as
they had sought him, not he them, they bore
with his eccentricities. Each pool manager had
his way, just as there are various kinds of
pools.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sam is not half a bad fellow,” Greenbaum told
them, as if apologizing for a dear friend’s weaknesses.
“He wants to make out he is a devil of a
cynic, but he’s all right. If you humor him you
can make him do anything. <em>I</em> always let him
have his way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the very next day began the historical advance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>in Turpentine. It opened up at 30. The
specialists—brokers who made a specialty of dealing
in it—took 16,000 shares, causing an advance
to 32⅛. Everybody who had been “landed” with
the shares at higher figures, and had bitterly regretted
it ever since, now began to feel hopeful.
As never before a stock had been manipulated,
with intent to deceive and malice prepense, so did
Sharpe manipulate Turpentine stock. The tape
told the most wonderful stories in the world, not
the less wonderful because utterly untrue. Thus,
one day the leading commission houses in the Street
were the buyers, which inevitably led to talk of
“important developments”; and the next day
brokers identified with certain prominent financiers
took calmly, deliberately, nonchalantly, all the
offerings; which clearly indicated that the aforementioned
financiers had acquired a “controlling
interest”—the majority of the stock—of the
American Turpentine Company. And on another
day there was a long string of purchases of “odd”
lots—amounts less than 100 shares—by brokers
that usually did business for the Greenbaum syndicate,
meaning that friends of the syndicate had
received a “tip” straight from “the inside” and
were buying for investment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, one fine, sunshiny day, when everybody felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>very well and the general market was particularly
firm, the loquacious tape told the watchful professional
gamblers of Wall Street—oh, so plainly!—that
there was “inside realizing”; said, almost
articulately to them, that the people most familiar
with the property were unloading. Sharpe was
selling, with intentional clumsiness, stock he had
been forced to accumulate during his bull manipulation—for
in order to advance the price he
had to buy much—and he was not averse to conveying
such impressions as would lead to the
creation of a short interest, large enough to make
it profitable to “squeeze.” He had too much
company on the bull side. And sure enough the
professional gamblers said: “Aha! They are
through with it. The movement is over!” and
sold “Turp” short confidently, for a worthless
stock had no business to be selling at $46 a share.
The price yielded and they sold more the next
day. But lo, on the day following, the Board
member of a very conservative house went into
the “Turp” crowd and bought it—he did not
“bid up” the price at all, but bought and bought
until he had accumulated 20,000 shares, and the
bears became panic-stricken, and rumors of a
nearby dividend began to circulate, and the bears
covered their shorts at a loss and “went long”—bought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>in the hope of a further rise—and the
stock closed at 52.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Sharpe reduced very greatly the amount
of “Turp” stock he had been obliged to take for
manipulative purposes. So far he was buying
more than he sold. Later he would sell more
than he bought. When the demand exceeds the
vendible supply, obviously the price rises; when
the supply for sale exceeds the demand, a fall results.
But the average selling price of a big line
may be high enough to make the operation profitable,
even though a decline occurs during the
course of the selling.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a week “Turp” rested; then it began to
rise once more. At 56 and 58 it became the
most active stock of the entire list. Everybody
talked about it. The newspapers began to publish
statements of the company’s wonderful earnings,
and the Street began to think that, in
common with other “trusts,” the American Turpentine
Company must be a very prosperous concern.
The company at this time developed a
habit of advancing prices a fraction of a cent per
gallon every week, so that the papers could talk
of the boom in the turpentine trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>At 60 the Street thought there really must be
something behind the movement, for no mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>manipulation could put up the price thirty points
in a month’s time, which shows what a wonderful
artist Sharpe was. And people began to look
curiously and admiringly and enviously and in
many other ways at “Jakey” Greenbaum and
his accomplices, and to accuse them of having intentionally
kept down the price of the stock for
a year in order to “freeze out” the poor, unsophisticated
stockholders, and to “tire out” some
of the early buyers, because “Turp,” being “a
good thing,” Greenbaum <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</span></i> wanted it all for
themselves. And Greenbaum <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</span></i> smiled guiltily
and said nothing, though Jakey winked
from time to time when they spoke to him about
it; and old Isidore Wechsler cultivated a Napoleon
III. look of devilish astuteness; and “Bob”
Lindheim became almost dignified; and myopic
little Morris Steinfelder gained 15 pounds and
Rosenthal stopped patting everybody on the
back, and mutely invited everybody to pat him
on the back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Sharpe sent for “Jakey,” and on the
next day young “Eddie” Lazarus swaggeringly
offered to wager $10,000 against $5,000 that a
dividend on “Turp” stock would be declared
during the year. Whereupon the newspapers of
their own accord began to guess how great a dividend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>would be paid, and when; and various figures
were mentioned in the Board room by brokers
who confided to their hearers that they “got
it on the dead q. t., <em>straight from the inside</em>.”
And two days later Sharpe’s unsuspected brokers
offered to pay 1¾ per cent for the dividend on
100,000 shares, said dividend to be declared
within sixty days or the money forfeited. And
the stock sold up to 66¾, and the public wanted
it. A big, broad market had been established,
in which one could buy or sell the stock with
ease by the tens of thousands of shares. The
114,400 shares, which at the inception of the
movement at the unsalable price of $30 a share
represented a theoretical $3,432,000, now readily
vendible at $65 a share, meant $7,422,000; not
half bad for a few weeks’ work.</p>

<p class='c000'>And still Sharpe, wonderful man that he was,
gave no sign that he was about to begin unloading.
Whereupon the other members of the
pool began to wish he were not quite so greedy.
They were satisfied to quit, they said. The presence
of the pool’s stock in their offices began to
irritate them. They knew the vicissitudes of life,
the uncertainties of politics, and of the stock
market. Supposing some crazy anarchist blew
up the President of the United States, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Emperor of Germany were to insult his grandmother,
the market would “break” to pieces, and
their $4,000,000 of paper profits would disappear.
They implored, individually and collectively,
Mr. Jacob Greenbaum to call on Sharpe;
and Greenbaum, disregarding a still, small voice
that warned him against it, went to Sharpe’s
office, and came out of it, two minutes later,
somewhat flushed, and assured his colleagues one
by one that Sharpe was all right, and that he
seemed to know his business. Also, that he was
cranky that day. He always was, added Greenbaum
forgivingly, when one of his horses lost a
race.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stock fluctuated between 60 and 65. It
seemed to be having a resting spell. But as it
had enjoyed these periods of repose on three several
occasions during the rise—at 40 and 48 and
56–-the public became all the more eager to buy
it whenever it fell to 60 or 59, for the Street was
now full of tips that “Turp” would go to par.
And such was the public’s speculative temper and
Mr. Sharpe’s good work that disinterested observers
were convinced the stock would surely sell
above 90 at the very least. Mr. Sharpe still
bought and sold, but he sold twice as much as
he bought, and the big block he had been obliged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to take in the course of his manipulation diminished.
On the next day he hoped to begin selling
the pool stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>That very day Mr. Greenbaum, as he returned
to his office from his luncheon, felt well pleased
with the meal and therefore with himself and
therefore with everything. He scanned a yard or
two of the tape and smiled. “Turp” was certainly
very active and very strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In such a market,” thought Mr. Greenbaum,
“Sharpe can’t possibly tell he’s getting stock
from me. In order to be on the safe side I’m going
to let him have a couple of thousand. Then,
should anything happen, I’d be that much ahead.
Ike!” he called to a clerk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sell two—wait; make it 3,000–-no, never
mind. Send for Mr. Ed Lazarus.” And he
muttered to himself, with a sub-thrill of pleasure:
“I can just as well as not make it 5,000 shares.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eddie,” he said to his partner’s son, “give an
order to some of the room traders, say to Willie
Schiff, to sell five—er—six—tell him to sell
7,000 shares of Turpentine and to borrow the
stock. I am not selling a share, see?” with a
wink. “It’s short selling by him, do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Do I? Well, I guess. I’ll fix that part O.K.,”
said young Lazarus, complacently. He thought he
would cover Greenbaum’s tracks so well as to deceive
everybody, including that highly disagreeable man,
Samuel Wimbleton Sharpe. He felt so confident,
so elated, did the young man, that when he gave
the order to his friend and club-mate, Willie
Schiff, he raised it to 10,000 shares. Greenbaum’s
breach of faith had grown from the relatively
small lot of 2,000 shares to five times that
amount. It was to all appearances short stock,
and it was duly “borrowed” by young Schiff. It
was advisable that it should so appear. In the
first place no member of the pool could supply the
stock which he held, because Sharpe could trace
the selling to the office, as he had the numbers of
the stock certificates. And, again, short selling
does not have the weakening effect that long selling
has. When stock is sold short it is evident
that sooner or later the seller will have to buy it
back; that is, a future demand for the stock is
assured from this source, if from no other.
Whereas, long stock is that actually held by some
one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Isidore Wechsler, who held 14,000 shares, was
suffering from a bad liver the same day that
Greenbaum was suffering from nothing at all, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>even a conscience. A famous art collection would
be sold at auction that week, and he felt sure his
vulgar friend, “Abe” Wolff, would buy a couple
of exceptionally fine Troyons and a world-famous
Corot, merely to get his name in the papers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Turp,’ 62⅞,” said his nephew, who was standing
by the ticker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then old Wechsler had an idea. If he sold
2,000 shares of Turpentine at 62 or 63, he would
have enough to buy the best ten canvases of the
collection. His name—and the amounts paid—would
grace the columns of the papers. What
was 3,000 shares, or even 4,000, when Sharpe had
made such a big, broad market for the stock?</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, I might as well make it 5,000 shares
while I’m about it, for there’s no telling what may
happen if Sharpe should overstay his market.
I’ll build a new stable at Westhurst”—his country
place—“and call it,” said old Wechsler to
himself, in his peculiar, facetious way so renowned
in Wall Street, “the Turpentine Horse Hotel, in
honor of Sharpe.” And so his 5,000 shares were
sold by E. Halford, who had the order from Herzog,
Wertheim &amp; Co., who received it from Wechsler.
It was short selling, of course.</p>

<p class='c000'>Total breach of faith, 15,000 shares.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that very evening Bob Lindheim’s extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>handsome wife wanted a necklace, and
wanted it at once; also she wanted it of filbert-sized
diamonds. She had heard her husband speak
highly of Sam Sharpe’s masterly manipulation of
Turpentine, and she knew he was “in on the
ground floor.” She read the newspapers, and she
always followed the stock market diligently, for
Bob, being young and loving, used to give her a
share in his stock deals from time to time, and
she learned to figure for herself her “paper” or
theoretical profits, when there were any, so that
Bob couldn’t have “welched” if he had wished.
On this particular evening she had statistics ready
for him, showing how much money he had made;
and she wanted that necklace. She had longed
for it for months. It cost only $17,000. But
there was also a lovely bracelet, diamonds and
rubies, and——</p>

<p class='c000'>Lindheim, to his everlasting credit, remonstrated
and told her: “Wait until the pool realizes,
sweetheart. I don’t know at what price that
will be, for Sharpe says nothing. But I know
we’ll all make something handsome, and so will
you. I’ll give you 500 shares at 30. There!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I want it now!” she protested, pouting.
She was certainly beautiful, and when she pouted,
with her rich, red lips——</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Wait a week, dear,” he urged nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lend me the money now, and I’ll pay it back
to you when you give me what I make on the
deal,” she said, with fine finality. And seeing
hesitation in Bob’s face, she added, solemnly:
“Honest, I will, Bob. I’ll pay you back every
cent, this time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll think about it,” said Bob. He always
said it when he had capitulated, and she knew it,
and so she said, magnanimously: “Very well,
dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lindheim thought 1,000 shares would do it, so
he decided to sell a thousand the next day, for
you can never tell what may happen, and accidents
seldom help the bulls. But as he thought
of it in his office more calmly, more deliberately,
away from his wife and from the influence she exercised
over him, it struck him forcibly that it was
wrong to sell 1,000 shares of Turpentine stock.
He might as well as not make it 2,500; and he
did. He was really a modest fellow, and very
young. His wife’s cousin sold the stock for him,
apparently short.</p>

<p class='c000'>Total breach of faith, 17,500 shares. The
market stood it well. Sharpe was certainly a wonderful
chap.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately, Morris Steinfelder, Jr., decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to sell 1,500 “Turp,” and did so. The stock
actually rose a half point on his sales. So he sold
another 1,500, and, as a sort of parting shot, 500
shares more. All this through an unsuspected
broker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Total breach of faith, 21,000 shares. The
market was but slightly affected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Louis Reis of Reis &amp; Stern, “Andy”
Fischel of Kohn, Fischel &amp; Co., Hugo Zeman of
Zeman Bros., and “Joe” Shaffran of Rosenthal,
Shaffran &amp; Co., all thought they could break
their pledges to Sharpe with impunity, and each
sold, to be on the safe side. This last lump figured

<p class='c000'>The market did not take it well. Sharpe, endeavoring
to realize on the remainder of his manipulative
purchases, found that “some one had
been there before him.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>An accurate list of the buyers and sellers was
sent in every day by his lieutenants, for all but
the most skilful operators invariably betray themselves
when they attempt to sell a big block of
stock. He scanned it very carefully now, and
put two and two together; and he made certain
inquiries and put four and four together—four
names and four other names. He saw through
the time-worn device of the fictitious short selling.
He knew the only people who would dare sell
such a large amount must be his colleagues. He
also was convinced that their breach of faith was
not a concerted effort, because if they had discussed
the matter they would have sold a smaller
quantity. He knew where nearly every share of
the stock was. It was his business to know everything

started the stock rushing upward with a vengeance-–63,
64, 65, 66, four points in as many minutes.
The floor of the Stock Exchange was the
scene of the wildest excitement. The market—why,
the market was simply Turpentine. Everybody
was buying it, and everybody was wondering
how high it would go, Greenbaum and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>other seven included. It looked as if the stock
had resumed its triumphant march to par.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Sharpe called in all the stock his brokers
were loaning to the shorts, and he himself began
to borrow it. This, together with the legitimate
requirements of the big short interest, created a
demand so greatly in excess of the supply that
Turpentine loaned at a sixty-fourth, at a thirty-second,
at an eighth, and finally at a quarter premium
over night. It meant that the shorts had
either to cover or to pay $25 per diem for the
use of each 100 shares of stock they borrowed.
On the 31,400 shares that the syndicate was borrowing
it meant an expense of nearly $8,000 a
day; and in addition the stock was rising in
price. The shorts were losing at the rate of
many thousands a minute. There was no telling
where the end would be, but it certainly looked
stormy for both the real and the fictitious shorts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sharpe sent a peremptory message to
Greenbaum, Lazarus &amp; Co.; I. &amp; M. Wechsler;
Morris Steinfelder’s Sons; Reis &amp; Stern; Kohn,
Fischel &amp; Co.; Silberman &amp; Lindheim; Rosenthal,
Shaffran &amp; Co.; and Zeman Bros. It was
the same message to all:</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Send me at once all your Turpentine stock!</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was consternation and dismay, also admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and self-congratulation, among the recipients
of the message. They would have to buy
back in the open market the stock they had sold
a few days before. It would mean losses on the
treasonable transactions of fully a quarter of a
million, but the pool “stood to win” simply fabulous
sums, if Mr. Sharpe did his duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were some large blocks of stock for sale
at 66, but Sharpe’s brokers cleared the figures
with a fierce, irresistible rush, whooping exultantly.
The genuine short interest was simply panic-stricken,
and atop it all there came orders to buy
an aggregate of 31,400 shares—orders from
Messrs. Greenbaum, Wechsler, Lindheim, Steinfelder,
Reis, Fischel, Shaffran, and Zeman. The
stock rose grandly on their buying: 4,000 shares
at 66; 2,200 at 66⅜; 700 at 67⅝; 1,200 at 68;
3,200 at 69½; 2,000 at 70; 5,700 at 70½; 1,200
at 72. Total, 31,400 shares bought in by
the “Skindicate.” Total, 31,400 shares sold by
Samuel Wimbleton Sharpe to his own associates
in the great Turpentine pool. In all he found
buyers for 41,700 shares that day, but it had
taken purchases of exactly 21,100 to “stampede
the shorts” earlier in the day, and in addition he
held 17,800 shares acquired in the course of his
bull manipulation, which had not been disposed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>when he discovered the breach of faith, so that at
the day’s close he found himself not only without
a share of stock manipulatively purchased, but
“short” for his personal account of 2,800 shares.</p>

<p class='c000'>The newspapers published picturesque accounts
of the “Great Day in Turpentine.” A powerful
clique, they said, owned so much of the stock—had
“cornered” it—that they could easily
mark up the price to any figure. They called it
a “memorable squeeze.” It was hinted also that
Mr. Sharpe had been on the wrong side of the
market, and one paper gave a wealth of details
and statistics in bold, bad type to prove that the
wily bear leader had been caught short of 75,000
shares, and had covered at a loss of $1,500,000.
A newspaper man whose relations with Sharpe
were intimate asked him, very carelessly: “What
the deuce caused the rise in Turpentine?” and
Sharpe drawled: “I don’t know for a certainty,
but I rather imagine it was inside buying!”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the next day came the second chapter of
the big Turpentine deal. Mr. Sharpe, having received
the pool’s 114,400 shares, divided it into
three lots, 40,000 shares, 50,000 shares, and 24,400
shares. The market had held fairly strong,
but the lynx-eyed room traders failed to perceive
the usual “support” in “Turp” and began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>sell it in order to make sure. There was enough
commission-house buying and belated short-covering
to keep it moderately steady. Then the
room traders redoubled their efforts to depress it,
by selling more than there were buying orders
for; also by selling it cheaper than was warranted
by the legitimate demand for the stock. It was
a favorite trick to offer to sell thousands of shares
lower than people were willing to pay, in order to
frighten the timid holders and make them sell;
which in turn would make still others sell, until
the movement became general enough to cause a
substantial fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly the price began to yield. All that was
needed was a leader. Whereupon Mr. Sharpe
took the first lot of pool stock, 40,000 shares,
and hurled it full at the market. The impact was
terrible; the execution appalling. The market
reeled crazily. The stock, which after selling up
to 72¾ had “closed” on the previous day at 71⅞,
dropped twenty points and closed at 54. The
newspapers said that the corner was “busted”;
that the “squeeze” was over. Hundreds of people
slept ill that night. Scores did not sleep at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the next day he fired by volleys 50,000
shares more at the market. The stock sank to
41¼. Such a break was almost unprecedented.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The Street asked itself if it were not on the eve
of a crash that would become historic in a district
whose chronology is reckoned by big market
movements.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greenbaum rushed to Sharpe’s office. The terrible
break gave him courage to do anything. A
Wall Street worm will turn when the market
misbehaves itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter?” he asked angrily.
“What are you doing to Turpentine?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sharpe looked him full in the face, but his
voice was even and emotionless as he replied:
“Somebody has been selling on us. I don’t know
who. I wish I did. I was afraid I might have
to take 100,000 shares more, so I just sold as
much as I could. I’ve marketed most of the
pool’s stock. If it had not been for the jag of
stock I struck around 60 and 62, Turpentine
would be selling at 85 or 90 to-day. Come
again next week, Greenbaum; and keep cool.
Did you ever know me to fail? Good-by, Greenbaum;
and don’t raise your voice when you speak
to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This has gone too far,” said Greenbaum,
hotly. “You must give me an explanation or by
Heaven I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Greenbaum,” said Mr. Sharpe, in a listless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>voice, “don’t get excited. Good-by, Greenbaum.
Be virtuous and you will be happy.” And he
resumed his caged-tiger pacing up and down his
office. As by magic, Mr. Sharpe’s burly private
secretary appeared, and said: “This way, Mr.
Greenbaum,” and led the dazed Trust-maker from
the office. On his return Sharpe told him:
“There is no need to accuse those fellows of
breach of faith. They’d deny it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day Mr. Sharpe simply poured the
remaining 25,000 shares of the pool’s stock on
the market as one pours water from a pitcher into
a cup. The bears had it all their own way. The
loquacious tape said, ever so plainly: “This is
nothing but inside liquidation, all the more
dangerous and ominous since it is at such low
figures and is so urgent in its character. Heaven
alone can tell where it will end; and there is no
telephone communication thither.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody was selling because somebody had
started a rumor that the courts had dissolved the
company for gross violation of the Anti-Trust
law, and that a receiver had been appointed.
Having sold out the last of the pool’s stock, Mr.
Sharpe “took in” at $22 a share the 2,800 shares
which he had put out at $72, a total profit on
his small “line” of $140,000.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Turpentine stock had declined fifty points in
fifteen business hours. It meant a shrinkage in
the market value of the company’s capital stock
of $15,000,000. The shrinkage in the self-esteem
of some of the pool was measurable only
in billions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sharpe notified his associates that the pool had
completely realized—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, had sold out—and that
he would be pleased to meet them at his office on
Monday—this was Thursday—at eleven <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.M.</span></span>,
when he would have checks and an accounting
ready for them. He refused himself to Greenbaum,
Wechsler, Zeman, Shaffran, and others
who called to see what could be done to save
their reputations from the wreck of Turpentine.
The stalwart private secretary told them that Mr.
Sharpe was out of town. He was a very polite
man, was the secretary; and an amateur boxer of
great proficiency.</p>

<p class='c000'>Failing to find Sharpe, they hastily organized a
new pool, of a self-protective character, and sent
in “supporting” orders. They were obliged to
take large quantities of stock that day and the
next in order to prevent a worse smash, which
would hurt them in other directions. They found
themselves with more than 50,000 shares on their
hands, and the price was only 26 @ 28. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>merely to try to sell the stock at that time
threatened to start a fresh Turpentine panic.</p>

<p class='c000'>They met Sharpe on Monday. His speech was
not so short as usual. He had previously sent to
each man an envelope containing a check and a
statement, and now he said, in a matter-of-fact
tone:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gentlemen and Greenbaum, you all know
what I did for Turpentine on the up-tack.
Around 62 I began to strike some stock which I
couldn’t account for. I knew none of you had
any for sale, of course, as you had pledged me
your honorable words not to sell, save through
me. But the stock kept coming out, even though
the sellers borrowed against it, as if it were short
stock, and I began to fear I had met an inexhaustible
supply. It is always best on such
occasions to act promptly, and so, after driving in
the real shorts, I sold out our stock. The average
selling price was 40. If it had not been for that
mysterious selling it would have been 80. After
commissions and other legitimate pool expenses, I
find we have made nine points net, or $1,029,600,
of which 25 per cent., or $250,000, come to me
according to the agreement. It is too bad some
people didn’t know enough to hold their stock for
90. But I find Wall Street is full of uncertainties—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>is so much stupidity in the district.
I trust you are satisfied. In view of the circumstances,
I am. Yes, indeed. Good-day, gentlemen;
and you too, Greenbaum, good-day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was nothing tigerish about him. He
was affable and polished; they could see that he
seemed pleased to the purring point. He nodded
to them and went into his inner office.</p>

<p class='c000'>They blustered and fumed among themselves
and gained courage thereby and tried Sharpe’s
door and found it locked. They knocked thereon,
vehemently, and the ubiquitous private secretary
came out and told them that Mr. Sharpe had an
important engagement and could not be disturbed,
but that he was authorized to discuss any item of
the statement, and he had charge of all the
vouchers, in the shape of brokers’ reports, etc.
So they expressed their opinions of the private
secretary and of his master rather mildly, and
went out, crestfallen. Outside they compared
notes, and in a burst of honesty they confessed.
Then, illogically enough, they cursed Sharpe.
The pool was not “ahead of the game.” They
had so much more stock on their hands than they
desired, that in reality they were heavy losers!</p>

<p class='c000'>And as time wore on they had to buy more
“Turp”; and more “Turp”; and still more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Turp.” They thought they could emulate
Sharpe and rush the price up irresistibly, at any
rate up to 50. They declared a dividend of 2
per cent on the stock. But they could not
market Turpentine. Again and again they tried,
and again and again they failed. And each time
the failure was worse because they had to take
more stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is now quoted at 16 @ 18. But it is not
readily vendible at that figure; nor, indeed, at any
price. Opposition distilleries are starting up in
all the turpentine districts, and the trade outlook
is gloomy. And the principal owners of the
stock of the American Turpentine Company,
holding among them not less than 140,000 out
of the entire issue of 300,000 unvendible shares,
are the famous “Greenbaum Skindicate.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE TIPSTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Gilmartin was still laughing professionally at the
prospective buyer’s funny story when the telephone
on his desk buzzed. He said: “Excuse me for a
minute, old man,” to the customer—Hopkins,
the Connecticut manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hello; who is this?” he spoke into the transmitter.
“Oh, how are you?—Yes—I was out—Is
that so?—Too bad—Too bad—Yes; just
my luck to be out. I might have known it!—Do
you think so?—Well, then, sell the 200 Occidental
common—You know best—What about
Trolley?—Hold on?—All right; just as you
say—I hope so—I don’t like to lose, and—Ha!
Ha!—I guess so—Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s from my brokers,” explained Gilmartin,
hanging up the receiver. “I’d have saved five hundred
dollars if I had been here at half-past ten.
They called me up to advise me to sell out, and the
price is off over three points. I could have got out
at a profit, this morning; but, no sir; not I. I
had to be away, trying to buy some camphor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hopkins was impressed. Gilmartin perceived
it and went on, with an air of comical wrath which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>he thought was preferable to indifference: “It
isn’t the money I mind so much as the tough luck
of it. I didn’t make my trade in camphor after
all and I lost in stocks, when if I’d only waited
five minutes more in the office I’d have got the
message from my brokers and saved my five hundred.
Expensive, my time is, eh?” with a woful
shake of the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you’re ahead of the game, aren’t you?”
asked the customer, interestedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I guess yes. Just about twelve thousand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That was more than Gilmartin had made; but
having exaggerated, he immediately felt very
kindly disposed toward the Connecticut man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whew!” whistled Hopkins, admiringly.
Gilmartin experienced a great tenderness toward
him. The lie was made stingless by the customer’s
credulity. This brought a smile of subtle relief
to Gilmartin’s lips. He was a pleasant-faced,
pleasant-voiced man of three-and-thirty. He exhaled
health, contentment, neatness, and an easy
conscience. Honesty and good-nature shone in
his eyes. People liked to shake hands with him.
It made his friends talk of his lucky star; and
they envied him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I bought this yesterday for my wife; took it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>out of a little deal in Trolley,” he told Hopkins,
taking a small jewel-box from one of the desk’s
drawers. It contained a diamond ring, somewhat
showy but obviously quite expensive. Hopkins’
semi-envious admiration made Gilmartin add,
genially: “What do you say to lunch? I feel I am
entitled to a glass of ‘fizz’ to forget my bad luck
of this morning.” Then, in an exaggeratedly
apologetic tone: “Nobody likes to lose five hundred
dollars on an empty stomach!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’ll be delighted, of course,” said Hopkins,
thinking of Mrs. Gilmartin. Mrs. Hopkins loved
jewelry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’s the nicest little woman that ever lived.
Whatever is mine, is hers; and what’s hers is her
own. Ha! Ha! But,” becoming nicely serious,
“all that I’ll make out of the stock market I’m
going to put away for her, in her name. She can
take better care of it than I; and, besides, she’s
entitled to it, anyhow, for being so nice to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That is how he told what a good husband he
was. He felt so pleased over it, that he went on,
sincerely regretful: “She’s visiting friends in
Pennsylvania or I’d ask you to dine with us.”
And they went to a fashionable restaurant
together.</p>

<p class='c000'>Day after day Gilmartin thought persistently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>that Maiden Lane was too far from Wall Street.
There came a week in which he could have made
four very handsome “turns” had he but been in
the brokers’ office. He was out on business for
his firm and when he returned the opportunity
had gone, leaving behind it vivid visions of what
might have been; also the conviction that time,
tide and the ticker wait for no man. Instead of
buying and selling quinine and balsams and essential
oils for Maxwell &amp; Kip, drug brokers and importers,
he decided to make the buying and selling
of stocks and bonds his exclusive business. The
hours were easy; the profits would be great. He
would make enough to live on. He would not
let the Street take away what it had given. That
was the great secret: to know when to quit! He
would be content with a moderate amount, wisely
invested in gilt-edged bonds. And then he would
bid the Street good-by forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Force of long business custom and the indefinable
fear of new ventures for a time fought successfully
his increasing ticker-fever. But one day
his brokers wished to speak to him, to urge him
to sell out his entire holdings, having been advised
of an epoch-making resolution by Congress.
They had received the news in advance from a
Washington customer. Other brokers had important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>connections in the Capital and therefore
there was no time to lose. They dared not
assume the responsibility of selling him out without
his permission. Five minutes—five eternities!—passed
before they could talk by telephone
with him; and when he gave his order to
sell, the market had broken five or six points.
The news was “out.” The news-agencies’ slips
were in the brokers’ offices and half of Wall
Street knew. Instead of being among the first ten
sellers Gilmartin was among the second hundred.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The clerks gave him a farewell dinner. All
were there, even the head office-boy to whom the
two-dollar subscription was no light matter. The
man who probably would succeed Gilmartin as
manager, Jenkins, acted as toastmaster. He
made a witty speech which ended with a neatly
turned compliment. Moreover, he seemed sincerely
sorry to bid good-by to the man whose departure
meant promotion—which was the nicest compliment
of all. And the other clerks—old Williamson,
long since ambition-proof; and young Hardy,
bitten ceaselessly by it; and middle-aged Jameson,
who knew he could run the business much
better than Gilmartin; and Baldwin, who never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>thought of business in or out of the office—all
told him how good he had been and related corroborative
anecdotes that made him blush and the
others cheer; and how sorry they were he would
no longer be with them, but how glad he was going
to do so much better by himself; and they
hoped he would not “cut” them when he met
them after he had become a great millionaire.
And Gilmartin felt his heart grow soft and feelings
not all of happiness came over him. Danny,
the dean of the office boys, whose surname was
known only to the cashier, rose and said, in the
tones of one speaking of a dear departed friend:
“He was the best man in the place. He always
was all right.” Everybody laughed; whereupon
Danny went on, with a defiant glare at the others:
“I’d work for him for nothin’ if he’d want me,
instead of gettin’ ten a week from anyone else.”
And when they laughed the harder at this he said,
stoutly: “Yes, I would!” His eyes filled with
tears at their incredulity, which he feared might
be shared by Mr. Gilmartin. But the toastmaster
rose very gravely and said: “What’s the matter
with Danny?” And all shouted in unison:
“He’s all right!” with a cordiality so heartfelt
that Danny smiled and sat down, blushing happily.
And crusty Jameson, who knew he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>run the business so much better than Gilmartin,
stood up—he was the last speaker—and began:
“In the ten years I’ve worked with Gilmartin,
we’ve had our differences and—well—I—well—er—oh,
DAMN IT!” and walked quickly to
the head of the table and shook hands violently
with Gilmartin for fully a minute, while all the
others looked on in silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gilmartin had been eager to go to Wall Street.
But this leave-taking made him sad. The old
Gilmartin who had worked with these men was
no more and the new Gilmartin felt sorry. He
had never stopped to think how much they cared
for him nor indeed how very much he cared for
them. He told them, very simply, he did not
expect ever again to spend such pleasant years
anywhere as at the old office; and as for his
spells of ill-temper—oh, yes, they needn’t shake
their heads; he knew he often was irritable—he
had meant well and trusted they would forgive
him. If he had his life to live over again he
would try really to deserve all that they had said
of him on this evening. And he was very, very
sorry to leave them. “Very sorry, boys; very
sorry. <em>Very</em> sorry!” he finished lamely, with a
wistful smile. He shook hands with each man—a
strong grip as though he were about to go on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>journey from which he might never return—and
in his heart of hearts there was a new doubt of
the wisdom of going to Wall Street. But it was
too late to draw back.</p>

<p class='c000'>They escorted him to his house. They wished
to be with him to the last possible minute.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Everybody in the drug trade seemed to think
that Gilmartin was on the high road to Fortune.
Those old business acquaintances and former competitors
whom he happened to meet in the streetcars
or in theatre lobbies always spoke to him
as to a millionaire-to-be, in what they imagined
was correct Wall Street jargon, to show him that
they too knew something of the great game. But
their efforts made him smile with a sense of superiority,
at the same time that their admiration
for his cleverness and their good-natured envy for
his luck made his soul thrill joyously. Among
his new friends in Wall Street also he found much
to enjoy. The other customers—some of them
very wealthy men—listened to his views regarding
the market as attentively as he, later, felt it
his polite duty to listen to theirs. The brokers
themselves treated him as a “good fellow.” They
cajoled him into trading often—every one-hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>shares he bought or sold meant $12.50 to
them—and when he won, they praised his unerring
discernment. When he lost they soothed
him by scolding him for his recklessness—just as
a mother will treat her three-years-old’s fall as a
great joke in order to deceive the child into
laughing at its misfortune. It was an average
office with an average clientele.</p>

<p class='c000'>From ten to three they stood before the quotation
board and watched a quick-witted boy chalk
the price-changes, which one or another of the
customers read aloud from the tape as it came
from the ticker. The higher stocks went the
more numerous the customers became, being allured
in great flocks to the Street by the tales of
their friends, who had profited greatly by the rise.
All were winning, for all were buying stocks in a
bull market. They resembled each other marvellously,
these men who differed so greatly in cast
of features and complexion and age. Life to all
of them was full of joy. The very ticker sounded
mirthful; its clicking told of golden jokes. And
Gilmartin and the other customers laughed heartily
at the mildest of stories without even waiting
for the point of the joke. At times their fingers
clutched the air happily, as if they actually felt
the good money the ticker was presenting to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>them. They were all neophytes at the great
game—lambkins who were bleating blithely to
inform the world what clever and formidable
wolves they were. Some of them had sustained
occasional losses; but these were trifling compared
with their winnings.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the slump came all were heavily committed
to the bull side. It was a bad slump. It
was so unexpected—by the lambs—that all of
them said, very gravely, it came like a thunderclap
out of a clear sky. While it lasted, that is,
while the shearing of the flock was proceeding, it
was very uncomfortable. Those same joyous,
winning stock-gamblers, with beaming faces, of
the week before, were fear-clutched, losing stock-gamblers,
with livid faces, on what they afterward
called the day of the panic. It really was only a
slump; rather sharper than usual. Too many
lambs had been over-speculating. The wholesale
dealers in securities—and insecurities—held
very little of their own wares, having sold them
to the lambs, and wanted them back now—cheaper.
The customers’ eyes, as on happier days
were intent on the quotation-board. Their
dreams were rudely shattered; the fast horses
some had all but bought joined the steam-yachts
others almost had chartered. The beautiful homes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>they had been building were torn down in the
twinkling of an eye. And the demolisher of
dreams and dwellings was the ticker, that instead
of golden jokes, was now clicking financial death.</p>

<p class='c000'>They could not take their eyes from the board
before them. Their own ruin, told in mournful
numbers by the little machine, fascinated them.
To be sure, poor Gilmartin said: “I’ve changed
my mind about Newport. I guess I’ll spend the
summer on my own <em>Hotel de Roof</em>!” And he
grinned; but he grinned alone. Wilson, the dry
goods man, who laughed so joyously at everybody’s
jokes, was now watching, as if under a
hypnotic spell, the lips of the man who sat on
the high stool beside the ticker and called out the
prices to the quotation boy. Now and again
Wilson’s own lips made curious grimaces, as if
speaking to himself. Brown, the slender, pale-faced
man, was outside in the hall, pacing to and
fro. All was lost, including honor. And he was
afraid to look at the ticker, afraid to hear the
prices shouted, yet hoping—for a miracle! Gilmartin
came out from the office, saw Brown and
said, with sickly bravado: “I held out as long as
I could. But they got <em>my</em> ducats. A sporting
life comes high, I tell you!” But Brown did not
heed him and Gilmartin pushed the elevator-button
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>impatiently and cursed at the delay. He
not only had lost the “paper” profits he had
accumulated during the bull-market but all his
savings of years had crumbled away beneath the
strokes of the ticker that day. It was the same
with all. They would not take a small loss at first
but had held on, in the hope of a recovery that
would “let them out even.” And prices had sunk
and sunk until the loss was so great that it seemed
only proper to hold on, if need be a year, for
sooner or later prices must come back. But the
break “shook them out,” and prices went just so
much lower because so many people had to sell,
whether they would or not.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>After the slump most of the customers returned
to their legitimate business—sadder, but it is to
be feared, not much wiser men. Gilmartin, after
the first numbing shock, tried to learn of fresh
opportunities in the drug business. But his heart
was not in his search. There was the shame of
confessing defeat in Wall Street so soon after
leaving Maiden Lane; but far stronger than this
was the effect of the poison of gambling. If it
was bad enough to be obliged to begin lower than
he had been at Maxwell &amp; Kip’s, it was worse to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>condemn himself to long weary years of work in
the drug business when his reward, if he remained
strong and healthy, would consist merely in being
able to save a few thousands. But a few lucky
weeks in the stock market would win him back all
he had lost—and more!</p>

<p class='c000'>He should have begun in a small way while he
was learning to speculate. He saw it now very
clearly. Every one of his mistakes had been due
to inexperience. He had imagined he knew the
market. But it was only now that he really knew
it and therefore it was only now, after the slump
had taught him so much, that he could reasonably
hope to succeed. His mind, brooding over his
losses, definitely dismissed as futile the resumption
of the purchase and sale of drugs, and dwelt persistently
on the sudden acquisition of stock market
wisdom. Properly applied, this wisdom ought to
mean much to him. In a few weeks he was again
spending his days before the quotation board,
gossiping with those customers who had survived,
giving and receiving advice. And as time passed
the grip of Wall Street on his soul grew stronger
until it strangled all other aspirations. He could
talk, think, dream of nothing but stocks. He
could not read the newspapers without thinking
how the market would “take” the news contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>therein. If a huge refinery burnt down, with a
loss to the “Trust” of $4,000,000, he sighed
because he had not foreseen the catastrophe and
had sold Sugar short. If a strike by the men of
the Suburban Trolley Company led to violence
and destruction of life and property, he cursed an
unrelenting Fate because he had not had the prescience
to “put out” a thousand shares of Trolley.
And he constantly calculated to the last fraction
of a point how much money he would have made
if he had sold short just before the calamity at
the very top prices and had covered his stock at
the bottom. Had he only known! The atmosphere
of the Street, the odor of speculation surrounded
him on all sides, enveloped him like a
fog, from which the things of the outside world
appeared as though seen through a veil. He
lived in the district where men do not say “Good-morning”
on meeting one another, but “How’s the
market?” or, when one asks: “How do you feel?”
receives for an answer: “Bullish!” or “Bearish!”
instead of a reply regarding the state of health.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first, after the fatal slump, Gilmartin importuned
his brokers to let him speculate on
credit, in a small way. They did. They were
kindly enough men and sincerely wished to help
him. But luck ran against him. With the obstinacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of unsuperstitious gamblers he insisted on
fighting Fate. He was a bull in a bear market;
and the more he lost the more he thought the
inevitable “rally” in prices was due. He bought
in expectation of it and lost again and again, until
he owed the brokers a greater sum than he could
possibly pay; and they refused point blank to
give him credit for another cent, disregarding his
vehement entreaties to buy a last hundred, just
one more chance, the last, because he would be
sure to win. And, of course, the long-expected
happened and the market went up with a rapidity
that made the Street blink; and Gilmartin figured
that had not the brokers refused his last order, he
would have made enough to pay off the indebtedness
and have left, in addition, $2,950; for he
would have “pyramided” on the way up. He
showed the brokers his figures, accusingly, and
they had some words about it and he left the
office, almost tempted to sue the firm for conspiracy
with intent to defraud; but decided that
it was “another of Luck’s sockdolagers” and let it
go at that, gambler-like.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he returned to the brokers’ office—the
next day—he began to speculate in the only way
he could—vicariously. Smith, for instance, who
was long of 500 St. Paul at 125, took less interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>in the deal than did Gilmartin who thenceforth
assiduously studied the news-slips and sought information
on St. Paul all over the Street, listening
thrillingly to tips and rumors regarding the
stock, suffering keenly when the price declined,
laughing and chirruping blithely if the quotations
moved upward, exactly as though it were
his own stock. In a measure it was as an anodyne
to his ticker-fever. Indeed, in some cases
his interest was so poignant and his advice so frequent—he
would speak of <em>our</em> deal—that the
lucky winner gave him a small share of his spoils,
which Gilmartin accepted without hesitation—he
was beyond pride-wounding by now—and
promptly used to back some miniature deal of his
own on the Consolidated Exchange or even in
“Percy’s”—a dingy little bucket-shop, where
they took orders for two shares of stock on a
margin of one per cent.; that is, where a man
could bet as little as two dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later, it often came to pass that Gilmartin
would borrow a few dollars, when the customers
were not trading actively. The amounts he borrowed
diminished by reason of the increasing frequency
of their refusals. Finally, he was asked
to stay away from the office where once he had
been an honored and pampered customer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>He became a Wall Street “has been” and
could be seen daily on New Street, back of the
Consolidated Exchange, where the “put” and
“call” brokers congregate. The tickers in the
saloons nearby fed his gambler’s appetite. From
time to time luckier men took him into the same
be-tickered saloons, where he ate at the free lunch
counters and drank beer and talked stocks and
listened to the lucky winners’ narratives with lips
tremulous with readiness to smile and grimace.
At times the gambler in him would assert itself
and he would tell the lucky winners, wrathfully,
how the stock he wished to buy but couldn’t the
week before, had risen 18 points. But they,
saturated with their own ticker-fever, would nod
absently, their soul’s eyes fixed on some quotation-to-be;
or they would not nod at all but in their
eagerness to look at the tape from which they had
been absent two long minutes, would leave him
without a single word of consolation or even of
farewell.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>V.</h3>

<p class='c016'>One day, in New Street, he overheard a very
well known broker tell another that Mr. Sharpe
was “going to move up Pennsylvania Central
right away.” The over-hearing of the conversation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>was a bit of rare good luck that raised Gilmartin
from his sodden apathy and made him
hasten to his brother-in-law who kept a grocery
store in Brooklyn. He implored Griggs to go to
a broker and buy as much Pennsylvania Central
as he could—that is, if he wished to live in
luxury the rest of his life. Sam Sharpe was going
to put it up. Also, he borrowed ten dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Griggs was tempted. He debated with himself
many hours, and at length yielded with misgivings.
He took his savings and bought one
hundred shares of Pennsylvania Central at 64 and
began to neglect his business in order to study
the financial pages of the newspapers. Little by
little Gilmartin’s whisper set in motion within
him the wheels of a ticker that printed on his
day-dreams the mark of the dollar. His wife, seeing
him preoccupied, thought business was bad;
but Griggs denied it, confirming her worst fears.
Finally, he had a telephone put in his little shop,
to be able to talk to his brokers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gilmartin, with the ten dollars he had borrowed,
promptly bought ten shares in a bucket
shop at 63⅞; the stock promptly went to 62⅞;
he was promptly “wiped”; and the stock
promptly went back to 64½.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the next day a fellow-customer of the Gilmartin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of old days invited him to have a drink.
Gilmartin resented the man’s evident prosperity.
He felt indignant at the ability of the other to
buy hundreds of shares. But the liquor soothed
him, and in a burst of mild remorse he told
Smithers, after an apprehensive look about him
as if he feared someone might overhear: “I’ll
tell you something, on the dead q. t., for your
own benefit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fire away!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pa. Cent. is going ‘way up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes?” said Smithers, calmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; it will cross par sure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Umph!” between munches of a pretzel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. Sam Sharpe told”—Gilmartin was on
the point of saying a “friend of mine” but
caught himself and went on, impressively—“told
me, yesterday, to buy Pa. Cent. as he had accumulated
his full line, and was ready to whoop it
up. And you know what Sharpe is,” he finished,
as if he thought Smithers was familiar with
Sharpe’s powers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is that so?” nibbled Smithers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, when Sharpe makes up his mind to put
up a stock, as he intends to do with Pa. Cent.,
nothing on earth can stop him. He told me he
would make it cross par within sixty days. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>is no hearsay, no tip. It’s cold facts. I don’t
<em>hear</em> it’s going up; I don’t <em>think</em> it’s going up; I
<em>know</em> it’s going up. Understand?” And he
shook his right forefinger with a hammering motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In less than five minutes Smithers was so
wrought up that he bought 500 shares and promised
solemnly not to “take his profits,” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> sell
out, until Gilmartin said the word. Then they
had another drink and another look at the
ticker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You want to keep in touch with me,” was
Gilmartin’s parting shot. “I’ll tell you what
Sharpe tells me. But you must keep it quiet,”
with a side-wise nod that pledged Smithers to
honorable secrecy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had Gilmartin met Sharpe face to face, he
would not have known who was before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after he left Smithers he buttonholed
another acquaintance, a young man who thought
he knew Wall Street, and therefore had a hobby—manipulation.
No one could induce him to
buy stocks by telling him how well the companies
were doing, how bright the prospects, etc. That
was bait for “suckers” not for clever young stock
operators. But anyone, even a stranger, who said
that “they”—the perennially mysterious “they,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the “big men,” the mighty “manipulators” whose
life was one prolonged conspiracy to pull the wool
over the public’s eyes—“they” were going to
“jack up” these or the other shares, was welcomed,
and his advice acted upon. Young Freeman
believed in nothing but “their” wickedness
and “their” power to advance or depress stock
values at will. Thinking of his wisdom had given
him a chronic sneer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re just the man I was looking for,” said
Gilmartin, who hadn’t thought of the young
man at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What Sam?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sharpe. The old boy sent for me. He was
in mighty good-humor too. Tickled to death.
He might well be—he’s got 60,000 shares of
Pennsylvania Central. And there’s going to be
from 50 to 60 points profit in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“H’m!” sniffed Freeman, skeptically, yet impressed
by the change in Gilmartin’s attitude
from the money-borrowing humility of the previous
week to the confident tone of a man with a
straight tip. Sharpe was notoriously kind to his
old friends—rich or poor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“I was there when the papers were signed,”
Gilmartin said, hotly. “I was going to leave the
room, but Sam told me I needn’t. I can’t tell
you what it is about; really I can’t. But he’s
simply going to put the stock above par. It’s
64½ now, and you know and I know that by the
time it is 75 the newspapers will all be talking
about inside buying; and at 85 everybody will
want to buy it on account of important developments;
and at 95 there will be millions of bull
tips on it and rumors of increased dividends, and
people who would not look at it thirty points
lower will rush in and buy it by the bushel. Let
me know who is manipulating a stock, and to
h—l with dividends and earnings. Them’s <em>my</em>
sentiments,” with a final hammering nod, as if
driving in a profound truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Same here,” assented Freeman, cordially. He
was attacked on his vulnerable side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange things happen in Wall Street. Sometimes
tips come true. It so proved in this case.
Sharpe started the stock upward brilliantly—the
movement became historic in the Street—and
Pa. Cent. soared dizzily and all the newspapers
talked of it and the public went mad over it and
it touched 80 and 85 and 88 and higher, and
then Gilmartin made his brother-in-law sell out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and Smithers and Freeman. Their profits were:
Griggs, $3,000; Smithers, $15,100; Freeman,
$2,750. Gilmartin made them give him a good
percentage. He had no trouble with his brother-in-law.
Gilmartin told him it was an inviolable
Wall Street custom and so Griggs paid, with an
air of much experience in such matters. Freeman
was more or less grateful. But Smithers met
Gilmartin and full of his good luck repeated what
he had told a dozen men within the hour: “I did
a dandy stroke the other day. Pa. Cent. looked to
me like higher prices and I bought a wad of it.
I’ve cleaned up a tidy sum,” and he looked proud
of his own penetration. He really had forgotten
that it was Gilmartin who had given him the tip.
But not so Gilmartin who retorted, witheringly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I’ve often heard of folks that you put
into good things and they make money and afterward
they come to you and tell how damned
smart they were to hit it right. But you can’t
work that on me. I’ve got witnesses.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Witnesses?” echoed Smithers, looking cheap.
He remembered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, wit-ness-es,” mimicked Gilmartin,
scornfully. “I all but had to get on my knees
to make you buy it. And I told you when to
sell it, too. The information came to me straight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>from headquarters and you got the use of it and
now the least you can do is to give me twenty-five
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the end he accepted $800. He told mutual
friends that Smithers had cheated him.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c016'>It seemed as though the regeneration of Gilmartin
had been achieved when he changed his
shabby raiment for expensive clothes. He paid
his tradesmen’s bills and moved into better
quarters. He spent his money as though he had
made millions. One week after he had closed
out the deal his friends would have sworn Gilmartin
had always been prosperous. That was
his exterior. His inner self remained the same—a
gambler. He began to speculate again, in
the office of Freeman’s brokers.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of the second month he had lost
not only the $1,200 he had deposited with the
firm, but an additional $250 he had given his
wife and had been obliged to “borrow” back
from her, despite her assurances that he would
lose it. This time, the slump was really unexpected
by all, even by the magnates—the mysterious
and all powerful “they” of Freeman’s—so
that the loss of the second fortune did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>reflect on Gilmartin’s ability as a speculator but
on his luck. As a matter of fact, he had been
too careful and had sinned from over-timidity at
first, only to plunge later and lose all.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the result of much thought about his losses
Gilmartin became a professional tipster. To
let others speculate for him seemed the only
sure way of winning. He began by advising ten
victims—he learned in time to call them clients—to
sell Steel Rod preferred, each man 100
shares; and to a second ten he urged the purchase
of the same quantity of the same stock.
To all he advised taking four points’ profit. Not
all followed his advice, but the seven clients who
sold it made between them nearly $3,000 over
night. His percentage amounted to $287.50.
Six bought and when they lost he told them confidentially
how the treachery of a leading member
of the pool had obliged the pool managers to
withdraw their support from the stock temporarily;
whence the decline. They grumbled; but he
assured them that he himself had lost nearly
$1,600 of his own on account of the traitor.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some months Gilmartin made a fair living
but business became very dull. People learned
to fight shy of his tips. The persuasiveness was
gone from his inside news and from his confidential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>advice from Sharpe and from his beholding
with his own eyes the signing of epoch-making
documents. Had he been able to make his customers
alternate their winnings and losses he
might have kept his trade. But for example,
“Dave” Rossiter, in Stuart &amp; Stern’s office, stupidly
received the wrong tip six times in succession.
It wasn’t Gilmartin’s fault but Rossiter’s
bad luck.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length failing to get enough clients in the
ticker-district itself Gilmartin was forced to advertise
in an afternoon paper, six times a week,
and in the Sunday edition of one of the leading
morning dailies. They ran like this:</p>

<p class='c000'>He prospered amazingly. Answers came to
him from furniture dealers on Fourth Avenue and
dairymen up the State and fruit growers in Delaware
and factory workers in Massachusetts and
electricians in New Jersey and coal miners in
Pennsylvania and shop keepers and physicians and
plumbers and undertakers in towns and cities near
and far. Every morning Gilmartin telegraphed to
scores of people—at their expense—to sell, and
to scores of others to buy the same stocks. And
he claimed his commissions from the winners.</p>

<p class='c000'>Little by little his savings grew; and with
them grew his desire to speculate on his own
account. It made him irritable, not to gamble.</p>

<p class='c000'>He met Freeman one day in one of his dissatisfied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>moods. Out of politeness he asked the
young cynic the universal query of the Street:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think of ‘em?” He meant
stocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What difference does it make what <em>I</em> think?”
sneered Freeman, with proud humility. “I’m
nobody.” But he looked as if he did not agree
with himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you <em>know</em>?” pursued Gilmartin,
mollifyingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know enough to be long of Gotham Gas.
I just bought a thousand shares at 180.” He
really had bought a hundred only.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What on?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On information. I got it straight from a
director of the company. Look here, Gilmartin,
I’m pledged to secrecy. But, for your own benefit,
I’ll just tell you to buy all the Gas you possibly
can carry. The deal is on. I know that
certain papers were signed last night, and they
are almost ready to spring it on the public. They
haven’t got all the stock they want. When they
get it, look out for fireworks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gilmartin did not perceive any resemblance between
Freeman’s tips and his own. He said, hesitatingly,
as though ashamed of his timidity:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The stock seems pretty high at 180.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“You won’t think so when it sells at 250.
Gilmartin, I don’t <em>hear</em> this; I don’t <em>think</em> it; I
<em>know</em> it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right; I’m in,” quoth Gilmartin, jovially.
He felt a sense of emancipation now that he had
made up his mind to resume his speculating. He
took every cent of the nine hundred dollars he
had made from telling people the same things
that Freeman told him now, and bought a hundred
Gotham Gas at $185 a share. Also he telegraphed
to all his clients to plunge in the stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>It fluctuated between 184 and 186 for a fortnight.
Freeman daily asseverated that “they”
were accumulating the stock. But, one fine day,
the directors met, agreed that business was bad
and having sold out most of their own holdings,
decided to reduce the dividend rate from 8 to 6
per cent. Gotham Gas broke seventeen points in
ten short minutes. Gilmartin lost all he had.
He found it impossible to pay for his advertisements.
The telegraph companies refused to accept
any more “collect” messages. This deprived
Gilmartin of his income as a tipster.
Griggs had kept on speculating and had lost all
his money and his wife’s in a little deal in Iowa
Midland. All that Gilmartin could hope to get
from him was an occasional invitation to dinner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Mrs. Gilmartin, after they were dispossessed for
non-payment of rent, left her husband and went
to live with a sister in Newark who did not like
Gilmartin.</p>

<p class='c000'>His clothes became shabby and his meals irregular.
But always in his heart, as abiding as an
inventor’s faith in himself, there dwelt the hope
that some day, somehow, he would “strike it
rich” in the stock market.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day he borrowed five dollars from a man
who had made five thousand in Cosmopolitan
Traction. The stock, the man said, had only
begun to go up, and Gilmartin believed it and
bought five shares in “Percy’s,” his favorite
bucket-shop. The stock began to rise slowly
but steadily. The next afternoon “Percy’s” was
raided, the proprietor having disagreed with the
police as to price.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gilmartin lingered about New Street, talking
with other customers of the raided bucket shop,
discussing whether or not it was a “put up job”
of old Percy himself who, it was known, had been
losing money to the crowd for weeks past. One
by one the victims went away and at length Gilmartin
left the ticker district. He walked slowly
down Wall Street, then turned up William
Street, thinking of his luck. Cosmopolitan Traction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>had certainly looked like higher prices. Indeed,
it seemed to him that he could almost hear
the stock shouting, articulately: “<em>I’m going up,
right away, right away!</em>” If somebody would
buy a thousand shares and agree to give him the
profits on a hundred, on ten, on one!</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had not even his carfare. Then he remembered
that he had not eaten since breakfast.
It did him no good to remember it now. He
would have to get his dinner from Griggs in
Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why,” Gilmartin told himself with a burst
of curious self-contempt, “I can’t even buy a cup
of coffee!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised his head and looked about him to
find how insignificant a restaurant it was in which
he could not buy even a cup of coffee. He had
reached Maiden Lane. As his glance ran up and
down the north side of that street, it was arrested
by the sign:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>MAXWELL &amp; KIP.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>At first he felt but vaguely what it meant. It
had grown unfamiliar with absence. The clerks
were coming out. Jameson, looking crustier than
ever, as though he were forever thinking how
much better than Jenkins he could run the business;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Danny, some inches taller, no longer an
office boy but spick and span in a blue serge suit
and a necktie of the latest style, exhaling health
and correctness; Williamson, grown very gray
and showing on his face thirty years of routine;
Baldwin, happy as of yore at the ending of the
day’s work, and smiling at the words of Jenkins—Gilmartin’s
successor who wore an air of authority,
of the habit of command which he had
not known in the old days.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of a sudden Gilmartin was in the midst of his
old life. He saw all that he had been, all that he
might still be. And he was overwhelmed. He
longed to rush to his old associates, to speak to
them, to shake hands with them, to be the old
Gilmartin. He was about to step toward
Jenkins; but stopped abruptly. His clothes
were shabby and he felt ashamed. But, he
apologized to himself, he could tell them how he
had made a hundred thousand and had lost it.
And he even might borrow a few dollars from
Jenkins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gilmartin turned on his heel with a sudden impulse
and walked away from Maiden Lane quickly.
All that he thought now was that he would
not have them see him in his plight. He felt the
shabbiness of his clothes without looking at them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>As he walked, a great sense of loneliness came
over him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was back in Wall Street. At the head of
the Street was old Trinity; to the right the sub-Treasury;
to the left the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Maiden Lane to the Lane of the Ticker—such
had been his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I could only buy some Cosmopolitan Traction!”
he said. Then he walked forlornly northward,
to the great Bridge, on his way to Brooklyn
to eat with Griggs, the ruined grocery-man.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>A PHILANTHROPIC WHISPER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>There have been all manner of big stock operators
and “leaders” in Wall Street—gentlemanly,
well-educated leaders with a gift of epigram and
foul-spoken leaders who knew as little of grammar
as of manners; leaders to whom the stock market
was only the Monte Carlo of the Tape and leaders
to whom it was a means to an end; cool, calculating,
steel-nerved leaders and fidgety, impulsive,
excitable leaders; leaders who were church pillars
and total abstainers and leaders whose only God
was the ticker and whose most brilliant operations
were carried on during the course of a drunken
debauch. But never before, in the breathless history
of Wall Street, had there been a leader whose
following was numbered by the thousands and
included not only the “shoe-string” speculators
but the very richest of the rich! Never before a
leader whose word took the place of statistical
information, whose mere “I am buying it” created
more purchasers for a stock than all the glowing
prospectuses and all the accountants’ affidavits and
all the bankers’ estimates.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first Wall Street said the public was suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>from an epidemic of speculative insanity;
that Colonel Treadwell was merely a bold operator
“backed” by a clique of the greatest fortunes
in America; that he was not a skilful “manipulator”
of values, but by sheer brute force of tremendous
buying he made those stocks advance
with which he was identified and that, of course,
the public always follows the stocks that are made
active; and many other explanations. But in
the end Wall Street came to realize exactly to
what it was that the blind devotion of the speculative
public for the colonel was due. Defying
all traditions, upsetting all precedents, violating
all rules, driving all the “veterans” to the verge
of hysterics and bankruptcy by his daily defiance
of accepted views as to the art of operating in
stocks, Colonel Josiah T. Treadwell founded a
new school: He told the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colonel sat in his office alone with his
thoughts. The door was open—it was always
open—and the clerks and customers of Treadwell
&amp; Co. as they passed to and fro caught
glimpses of the great leader’s broad, kindly face
and shrewd, little, twinkling eyes that seemed to
smile at them. They wondered what new “deal”
the colonel was planning. And then they wished
with all their souls and purses they knew the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of the stock—merely the name of it—so that
they might “get in on the ground floor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous operator sat on a revolving chair
by his desk. He had turned his back on an accumulation
of correspondence and he now rotated
from right to left and from left to right. The
tips of his shoes—he was a short man—missed
the floor by an inch or two and he swung his feet
contentedly. A ticker whirred away blithely and
from time to time Treadwell ceased his rocking
and his foot-swinging, and glanced jovially at the
ticker “tape.” From his window he could see a
Mississippi of people or a bit of New York summer
sky, but his restless eyes were roaming and
skipping from place to place. And the clerks
and the customers wondered whether the market
was going the way the colonel had planned. The
ticker was whirring and clicking, impassively, and
the colonel wore a meditative look. What was the
“old man” scheming? The bears had better be
on their guard! As a matter of fact, Josiah T.
Treadwell was thinking that his brother Wilson,
who had left him a few minutes before, was certainly
growing bald. He also wondered whether
people who advertised “restorers” and “invigorators”
were veracious or merely “Wall Streety”
as he put it to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>A young man, an utter stranger to Colonel
Treadwell, halted at the door, and looked at the
leader of the stock market, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come in, come in,” called out the colonel,
cheerily. “Won’t you walk into my parlor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning, Colonel Treadwell,” said the
lad, diffidently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who are you, and what are you, and what can
I do for you?” said the colonel, extending his
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The youth did not heed the chubby, outstretched
hand. “My name,” he said, very formally
and introductorily, “is Carey. My father
used to know you when he was editor of the
<cite>Blankburg Herald</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said the colonel, encouragingly, “shake
hands anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Carey shook hands; his diffidence vanished.
He was a pleasant-faced, pleasant-voiced young
fellow, Treadwell thought. He was a good-hearted,
jocular old fellow, unlike what he had
imagined the leader of the stock market would be,
Carey thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” went on the colonel, “I remember
your father very well. I never forget my up-the-State
friends, and I am always glad to see their
sons. When I ran for Congress, Bill Carey wrote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>red-hot editorials in my favor, and I was beaten
by a large and enthusiastic majority. I haven’t
seen your father in twenty-odd years—not since
he went wrong and took to politics.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Colonel Treadwell,” laughed Carey, “I
guess Dad did his best for you. And if you didn’t
go to Congress you’re better off, from all I have
read in the papers about you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>You would have thought they had known each
other for years.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s what I say; I have to,” chuckling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Colonel,” said the young man, boldly, “I’ve
come to ask your advice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Most people don’t ask it twice. Be careful
now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean that they get so rich following
it that they don’t have to come again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a politician, young man. You’ll
wake up and find yourself in Congress, some fine
day, unless your father goes back to newspaper
work and writes some editorials in <em>your</em> favor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy had a pleasant smile, the colonel
thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have saved up some money, Colonel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Keep it. That’s the best advice I can give
you. Go away instantly. Great Scott, youngster,
you are in Wall Street now.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Oh, I—I’m safe enough in this office, I
guess,” retorted Carey.</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous leader of the stock market looked
at him solemnly. The boy returned the look,
imperturbably. Then Colonel Treadwell laughed,
and Carey laughed back at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you doing to keep out of State’s
prison?” asked Treadwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m a clerk in the office of the Federal Pump
Company, third floor, upstairs. I have saved
some money and I want to know what to do with
it. I read an article in the <cite>Sun</cite> the other day.
It said you had advised people to put their savings
into Suburban Trolley and how well they
had fared.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was a year ago. Trolley has gone up
50 points since then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That shows how good the advice was. And
you also said a young man should do something
with his savings and not let them lie idle.” The
young man looked straight into the little, twinkling,
kindly eyes of the leader of the stock
market.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How much money have you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have two hundred and ten dollars,” replied
the lad with an uncertain smile. He had felt
proud of the magnitude of his savings in his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>room; in this office he felt a bit ashamed of their
insignificance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear me,” said the millionaire speculator,
very seriously, “that is a good deal of money.
It’s a blame sight more’n I had, when I started in
business. Got it with you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I’ll introduce you to my brother Wilson,
who has charge of our customers. Come in, John.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“John” came in. His other name was Mellen.
He was a slim, quiet-looking man of about five-and-fifty.
His enemies said that he had made
$1,000,000 for every year he had lived and had
kept it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sit down, John,” said Colonel Treadwell,
shaking hands with Mr. Mellen, “I’ll be back in a
minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the door he shook hands with two more
visitors—a tall, ruddy-faced, white-haired, and
white-whiskered man, Mr. Milton Steers, after-dinner
speaker and self-confessed wit; and, incidentally,
president of a railroad system; also Mr.
D. M. Ogden, who looked like an English clergyman
and was the owner of the huge Ogden Buildings
in Wall Street. They had come to discuss
the advisability of a new deal in “Trolley.”
They represented, they and their associates, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>than $500,000,000. But Colonel Treadwell made
them wait while he escorted his new acquaintance
to his brother’s room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wilse,” he said, “I’ve brought you a new
customer, Mr. Carey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Wilson P. Treadwell smiled pleasantly. He was
a tall, slender man with a serious look. The firm
did not desire new accounts, for there was already
more business than could be handled. They were
the busiest and the best-known stock brokers in
the United States. But the colonel’s friends
were welcome, always.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m very glad to meet Mr. Carey,” said Wilson
Treadwell. The firm had some very youthful
customers; but their means were in inverse
ratio to their years.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think,” said the colonel, “that we had better
buy some Easton &amp; Allentown for him.” He
was smiling; he generally did. Moreover, he
was thinking of his brother’s mistaken impression
of the new customer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is a good idea,” assented Wilson. “You
ought to put in your order at once. The stock
is going up very fast, Mr. Carey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, young man, give him your margin and
let him buy you as much as he thinks best,” said
the colonel.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Five thousand shares?” suggested Wilson
Treadwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Treadwell chuckled. “Five thousand?
A paltry five?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, fifty thousand if he wants them, and
you guarantee his account,” said his brother with
a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I guess,” said the leader of the stock market,
slowly, “that you had better begin with one hundred
shares.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Wilson, who knew his brother thoroughly,
said “Oh!” and smiled and gave an order to
a clerk to buy one hundred shares of Easton &amp;
Allentown Railroad stock at the “market” or
prevailing price, for Mr. Carey, and took the
boy’s two hundred and ten dollars with the
utmost gravity. The smallest Stock Exchange
house would not accept such a pitiful account.
Treadwell &amp; Co. being the largest, would and
did.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colonel shook hands with young Carey,
whose father had once edited a country newspaper,
but who had never been an intimate friend,
told him to “Come again, any time,” and went
back to his accomplices.</p>

<p class='c000'>Easton &amp; Allentown stock was the “feature”
of the market that week and the next. Ten days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>after Carey had bought his hundred shares at 94
the stock sold at 106.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man went into the office of Treadwell
&amp; Co., on the eleventh day. He knew he
had made a great deal of money—more than he
had ever thought of having at his age—but he
did not know what to do now. He heard one
man say to another: “Take profits? Not at
this price. E. &amp; A. is sure to go to 115.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Carey figured that if he waited for the stock to
sell at 115, he would make nearly a thousand dollars
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is no use of being a blamed hog,” the
man continued, with picturesque emphasis, “but
where in blazes is the sense of throwing away that
much money by selling out too soon? Limit
your losses and let your profits run.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They stood in the corridor of the partitioned
office, the crowd of men, all of them customers of
Treadwell &amp; Co., excepting the newspaper reporters
who had called for their usual daily interview
with the famous leader of the stock market.
There were two United States Senators; an ex-Congressman;
a score of men who had inherited
fortunes and were doubling them in the stock
market; three or four gray-haired shrewd-faced
capitalists whose names appeared many times in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the financial pages of newspapers; a baker’s dozen
of prominent municipal politicians, a well-known
Western railroad president with a ruddy face and
a snow-white beard; two famous physicians; the
vice-president of a life insurance company; a half
score of wholesale merchants and a low-voiced,
insignificant little man, with a quiet, almost
apologetic look, who seldom spoke and never
smiled, but who, next to the colonel himself, was
beyond question the heaviest “plunger” in the
office.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colonel came out of his office to go to his
brother’s room, where, seated about a long polished
table were several directors of the Suburban
Trolley Company—men to whom the newspapers
always referred not by name but as “prominent
insiders.” It was a very important gathering.
It involved no less than a final understanding in
regards to the great “Trolley pool” whose operations,
later on, were to become historical in Wall
Street. It was, as one of the speculators outside
put it, “a case of show down”—the cash resources
available for pool purposes were to be
ascertained, each man announcing the proportion
of the 100,000 shares for which he was willing to
“put up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Carey was standing by the door of Wilson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Treadwell’s office. He did not feel altogether
comfortable, among so many elderly and obviously
very rich men. His diffidence was the saving of
him for as the colonel passed he paused and said,
in a low voice: “Got your stock yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The customers in the corridor, men who, by the
colonel’s advice, were “carrying” from 500 to
10,000 shares each of Easton &amp; Allentown, leaned
forward eagerly. All were men who north of
Wall Street would not have stooped to listen to
others’ conversations if their lives depended on it.
In a broker’s office, when the leader of the stock
market was speaking, such notions were absurd,
almost wicked. Certainly, at that moment,
twenty pairs of eyes were looking fixedly at the
great leader of the stock market and the young
clerk.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colonel felt this intuitively. He confirmed
it with a quick glance of his sharp little eyes.
He had not sold all his Easton &amp; Allentown, but
was disposing of it just as fast as the market
would take it. It was not likely that the stock
would go much higher. Wall Street, ever loath
to believe well of any stock operator, used to
comment sneeringly on the fact that the world
heard much about the “Treadwell buying” but
never a word about the Treadwell selling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>If the colonel gave a hint to the customers
there would be an avalanche of selling orders that
would make the price of the stock break sharply,
and this would not benefit anyone. He had advised
them to buy the stock at 90 and at 95–-it
was 105 now. He had more than done his duty.
If they did not sell out, in the hope of making
more, it was their own lookout.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was the boy with the one hundred
shares, the pleasant little clerk from up-the-State,
who had brought in his entire fortune, his accumulated
savings of two hundred and ten dollars.
He was a stranger to Wall Street. But supposing
he should tell that he had been advised to
sell? There would be the deuce to pay!</p>

<p class='c000'>The colonel took chances. Out of one corner
of his mouth, so that he did not even turn his
head toward the boy and so that the watching customers
could not suspect what he was doing, he
shot a quick whisper—a lob-sided but philanthropic
affair—at him: “Look at the color of
your money, boy! Take your profits and say
nothing!” And he walked into the room where
the Suburban Trolley magnates awaited him
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carey, thrilled but taciturn, gave his order to
sell his Easton &amp; Allentown, unsuspected by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>mob. They sold it for him at 105⅛. Deducting
commissions and interest charges the colonel’s
whisper had put $1,050 in the young clerk’s
pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the stock went a little higher and then
declined slowly to about 99. The customers all
made a great deal of money as it was, but not as
much as they would have “taken out” of the
Easton &amp; Allentown “deal” if they had overheard
that one of Colonel Treadwell’s many whispers—lob-sided
but philanthropic affairs!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE MAN WHO WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Brown,” said Mr. John P. Greener, as he turned
away from the ticker in the corner, “I wish you
would go over to the Board and see how the market
is for Iowa Midland. Find out how much
stock there is for sale and who has it. It ought
to be pretty well distributed about the Street.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s up in it?” asked his partner, curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing—yet,” answered Greener, quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sat down at his desk and took up a letter,
headed “President’s Office, Keokuk &amp; Northern
Railway Company, Keokuk, Iowa.” When he
had finished the entire sixteen closely written
pages, he arose and paced slowly up and down his
office.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a sallow-faced, black-bearded little
man, slender—almost frail looking—with a high
but rather narrow forehead. His eyes were furtive,
shifty bits of brown light. He was thinking,
and thinking to some purpose. Any one,
even a stranger, seeing him, would have known
that he was thinking of something big—the forehead
was responsible for the impression; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>also of something tricky, unscrupulous, cold-blooded—his
eyes were to blame there. At length his
brow cleared. He muttered: “I must have
that road. Then, a consolidation with my Keokuk
&amp; Northern; and a new system that will endure
as long as the country!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brown returned in a half hour and reported.
There was very little stock for sale below $42 a
share—a few small lots held by unimportant commission
houses. The vendible supply increased at
44, and at 46 “inside stock would come out,”
which, translated into plain English, meant that
whenever the price of Iowa Midland Railway
Company stock rose to $46 per share, directors of
the company or close friends of theirs would be
found willing to part with their holdings. It was
thus evident that the greater part of such stock
of the Iowa Midland as the Street was “carrying”
speculatively was not for sale at such a price as
would be regarded in the light of a great bargain
by Mr. John F. Greener, president <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> of the
rival Keokuk &amp; Northern Railway, but better
known to countless “lambs” and widows and orphans
and brother financiers as the Napoleon of
the Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Any supporting orders?” piped Greener.
Stocks are “supported,” or bought on declines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>so that the price shall not go down too much, and
above all not too quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bagley has orders to buy 300 shares every
quarter of a point down until 37 is reached, and
then to take 5,000 shares at that figure. He got
them direct from Willetts himself.” Bagley was
a broker who made a specialty of dealing in Iowa
Midland. Willetts was the president of the company.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Willetts,” squeaked Greener, “was in Council
Bluffs this morning. He is to take part in the
ceremonies of unveiling the Soldiers’ Monument,
which begin at one o’clock—that is, within twenty
minutes, allowing for difference in time. He will
be out of the reach of the telegraph for the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brown laughed. “No wonder they are afraid
of you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brown,” said Greener, “start the movement
by selling 10,000 shares of Iowa Midland. Divide
it up among the boys on the floor. It would be
well if the room were frightened by the selling.
It is more important for us to get the price down
than to put out shorts at high figures. I want
that stock down.” If he had merely desired to sell
the stock “short” he would have gone about it
carefully, to disturb the price as little as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“If you want that I think you’ll get it,” said
Brown. As he was going out Mr. Greener
squeaked after him: “Keep them guessing,
Brown; keep them guessing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That,” mused Mr. John F. Greener, “ought
to mean a three-or four-point break in Iowa Midland
at the very least, and perhaps we can work
through the peg at 37. We’ll see.” By the
“peg” he meant the figure at which the supporting
orders to buy were heaviest.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few minutes later the Iowa Midland “post”
on the floor of the Stock Exchange was surrounded
by a dozen puzzled and apprehensive but gentlemanly
brokers. And still a few minutes later
the same spot was a seething whirlpool of maniacal
humanity. It was appalling, the sight of
these gesticulating, yelling, fighting, coat-tearing,
fisticuffing brokers—appalling and vulgar, selfish,
unpleasant, ungentlemanly but eminently
typical. And all that caused the transformation
was the fact that Mr. Brown had been seen whispering
to Harry Wilson, and Harry Wilson had
left him, gone to the Iowa Midland crowd, and
sold 1,000 shares at 42⅛ and 42. Then Mr.
Brown had been seen speaking with W. G. Carleton
in what struck witnesses as being a more or
less agitated manner, and later Carleton had sauntered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>carelessly over to the Iowa Midland precinct,
and, after displaying very great indifference
about the world in general, but most particularly
about the market for Iowa Midland, had sold
1,500 shares to Bagley, the specialist, at 41¾, 41⅝,
and 41½. Mr. Brown was now watched by two or
three scores of sharp eyes, all having the same expression.
And he was observed to look about
him apprehensively and then begin to converse
with Frank J. Pratt; whereupon Pratt, as fast as
his fat legs would carry him, hastened to “Iowa
Midland” and sold 2,000 shares at an average
price of 41. The observant eyes had by this
taken on a new expression—of indecision; but
when they beheld Mr. Brown anxiously beckon to
his “particular” friend, Dan Simpson, and saw
shrill-voiced Dan rush like mad into the increasing
crowd and sell 5,000 shares of Iowa Midland,
apparently regardless of price, the observant eyes
ceased to observe Brown. Activity was transferred
to their owners’ throats as they thought to emulate
Simpson and the rest of the Brown “whisperees.”
Everybody scented danger, especially
as the same “whisperees” had not “given up”
the name of Brown &amp; Greener as the real sellers,
but had sold as though each Brown-talked man
was acting for himself—which every other man in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the room knew was out of the question, and which,
in turn, increased the general uneasiness. It was
a confident and yet a mystifying movement. It
became more maddeningly perplexing when certain
brokers, believed to be “close to the inside,”
also began to sell the stock. Everybody started
to do likewise. And everybody asked the same
question—“What’s the matter?”—and received
an avalanche of answers, all different but all unfavorable.
One man said it was crop failures,
another mentioned divers kinds of bugs, a third
asserted it was extensive wash-outs and ruinous
landslides, and bankrupting attacks by a socialistic
legislature, and receivership probabilities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each of these was a good and sufficient reason
why Iowa Midland stock should be sold. The
comparison is odiously trite, but the growth of an
adverse rumor in Wall Street really resembles nothing
so much as the traditional snowball rolling
down a hillside and becoming larger and larger as
it rolls, until it is huge, terrific, with appalling
possibilities for evil.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Board Room became Iowa-Midland-mad.
Speculators often stampede—just like other animals.
No stock can withstand their rush to sell,
even though it be “protected” or “supported”
by its manipulators, much less a stock like Iowa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Midland, whose market sponsor was out of town,
and out of reach of the telegraph.</p>

<p class='c000'>From all over the room men rushed to Brown,
who was sitting calmly at the Erie “post,” chatting
pleasantly with a friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brown, what’s up in Iowa Midland?” one of
them asked, feverishly. The others listened eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brown might have said, “I don’t know,” rudely,
and turned his back on them. But he did not.
He responded jocularly: “It seems to me that
something is down in Iowa Midland, that something
being about three points, I should say.
Ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time nearly all the listeners had concluded
that, since Brown refused to tell, there
must be something serious—something very serious.
Brown obviously was still selling the stock
through other brokers, and would keep the bad
news to himself until he had marketed his “line.”
After that, probably he would become interestingly
garrulous. They therefore advised their respective
offices to get rid of their Iowa Midland
stock. It might be all right; but it might be all
wrong. And it was going down fast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Greener in his office was looking at the
“tape” as it came out of the little electrical printing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>machine that records the transactions and
prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sallow-faced little man permitted himself a
slight—a very slight—smile. The tape showed:
“IA. MID., 1000. 39; 300. 38¾; 500. ⅝; 300.
½; 200. ⅜; ¼; 300. 38.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned away to summon a clerk, to whom
he said: “Mr. Rock, please send for Mr. Coolidge.
Make haste.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A portly, white-waistcoated, white-haired man,
with snow-white, short-cropped side whiskers,
burst unceremoniously into the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you do, Mr. Ormiston?” squeaked
Greener, cordially.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Greener,” panted the portly man, “what’s the
matter with Iowa Midland?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How should I know?” in a half-complaining,
half-petulant squeak.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brown started the selling. I saw it myself.
Greener, I did you a good turn once in Central
District Telegraph. I’m long 6,000 shares of
this Iowa Midland. For God’s sake, man, if you
know anything——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Ormiston, all I know is what I learn from
my confidential reports of the Iowa crop. Along
the line of the Keokuk &amp; Northern the crop is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>not what I hoped for.” And he shook his head
dolefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Ticky-ticky-ticky tick!</em>” said the ticker,
calmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The portly man approached the little machine.
“Thirty-seven-and-an-eighth. Thirty-seven!”
he shouted. “Great Scott! she’s going down like
a——” He did not finish the comparison, but
rushed out of the office without pausing to say
good-by. At one o’clock his 6,000 shares at $42½
represented $255,000. Now, at two o’clock, at
$37, the same stock would fetch about $222,000.
A depreciation of $33,000 in an hour is apt to
make one neglectful of the little niceties. An
additional un-nicety was the obvious fact that an
attempt to sell 6,000 shares on a declining market
would inevitably cause a still further drop. Mr.
Ormiston was excusable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again Mr. Greener summoned a confidential
clerk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Rock,” he squeaked, placidly, “telephone
Mr. Brown that Ormiston, Monkhouse &amp; Co. are
about to sell 6,000 shares of Iowa Midland, and
that Mr. Coolidge must not pay more than 35
for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Coolidge is in your private room, sir,”
announced an office-boy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>The little financier, with an expressionless, sallow
face, confronted his chief confidential broker.
Their relations were unsuspected by the Street.
Everybody thought Coolidge was a pleasant and
honorable man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Coolidge, go to the Board at once. Ormiston
is going to sell 6,000 shares of Iowa Midland.
Get it as cheap as you can. Don’t be in a hurry,
though.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How much shall I buy?” asked the broker,
jotting down a few figures in his order book.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As much as you can; all that is offered below
37,” squeaked the Napoleon of the Street. It
was a Napoleonic order. “And, Coolidge, I don’t
want this known by any one. Clear the stock
yourself.” It meant that Mr. Coolidge was to put
the stock through the Clearing House in his own
name. As there is a charge for this service, in
addition to the usual buying or selling commission,
such steps are not resorted to unless it is desired
to conceal the identity of the broker’s principal,
should the latter be a fellow-member of the
Exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, Mr. Greener. Good-morning.”
And the broker went out on a run. “Whew!”
he whistled when he was in the Street on his way
to the Stock Exchange, a few doors below. “Brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>&amp; Greener must be short at least 50,000 or 60,000
shares.” This was five times too much. But
it showed that Mr. Greener was impartial in his
distribution of erroneous impressions. He wanted
to accumulate the stock rather than “cover” a
short line; but there was no reason why even his
most trusted broker should know it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ormiston’s 6,000 shares found their way to Mr.
Coolidge’s office at from 34⅞ to 35¾. Mr. Brown
in the meantime had succeeded in forcing down
the prices by the usual tricks. The man who
once had done Greener a good turn now did him
another—the gift of $40,000!</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition, Coolidge, employing several brokers,
purchased 23,000 shares in all, which meant that
Mr. Greener, after “covering” Brown’s early
“short sales,” was in possession of fully 14,000
shares of the common stock of the Iowa Midland
Railway Company, at a price averaging nearly 6
points lower than they could have been bought
on the preceding day, which is to say $75,000
cheaper.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Brown &amp; Greener had made as much on
their short sales, which was actually equivalent to
having the lambs pay a man for the privilege of
being shorn by him!</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the first of a series of skirmishes by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>means of which the diminutive Napoleon of the
Street captured the floating supply of Iowa Midland
stock, until he had no less than 65,000 shares
safe in his clutches.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the old tricks that he knew and new devices
he invented were used to hide from the Street
the fact that Mr. Greener was buying the stock
on every opportunity. But beyond a certain limit
extensive purchases of a particular stock cannot
be concealed from the thousand shrewd men who
make their living—a very good living, indeed—by
not being blind. First one thing, then another,
told these men that some powerful financier
or group of financiers had bought enormously of
Iowa Midland, “absorbing” unostentatiously all
the stock shaken out by the violent fluctuations
of the past few months. This fact and the remarkable
improvement of business along the line of the
road caused a “substantial rise” in the price of
the company’s securities. But no one suspected
the little Napoleon with the shifty eyes and the
squeak and the genius, who had bought in the
open market, through unsuspected brokers, and in
Iowa from the local holders, by means of secret
agents, until he had accumulated 78,600 shares.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brown said to his partner one day, a little uneasily:
“Supposing we can’t get any more stock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>what are we going to do with what we have?”
To try to sell it, however carefully, would be sure
to break the market.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brown,” squeaked the little man, plaintively,
“I have concluded that in case I can’t get enough
stock to bring Willetts and his crowd”—the
president of the Iowa Midland and his fellow-directors—“to
my way of thinking, we had better
sell the block we now hold to the Keokuk &amp;
Northern Railway Company at the market price
of $68 a share. Perhaps we could even run it up
a little higher. Our stock cost us on an average
$51 a share. We could take our payment one
half in cash and half in first mortgage bonds at a
fair discount. The deal would be highly beneficial
to the Keokuk &amp; Northern Company, since,
having such a large block of her rival’s stock,
there would be no more fighting and rate-cutting.
Our company would be a powerful factor in the
Iowa Midland’s affairs, for we ought to have two
or possibly three directors in their board.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Greener,” said Brown, “shake!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no; not yet,” squeaked the little man,
deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly afterward began a campaign of hostility
against the management of the Iowa Midland
Railway Company and President Willetts in particular.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>It was a bitter campaign of defamation,
of ingenious accusations, and of alarming prognostications.
All the newspapers, important or
obscure, subsidized or honest, began to print
articles of the kind technically known as “roasts.”
The road, it was declared, had escaped a receivership
by a sheer miracle. President Willetts’s incompetence
was stupendous and incurable. There
was, in sooth, some basis for the complaints, and
many stockholders were undoubtedly dissatisfied
with the Willetts “dynasty.” But not even the
newspapers themselves knew that they were merely
moving in response to wires artistically pulled by
a financial genius of the first water. The stock
once more declined. Not knowing who was fighting
him, President Willetts was unable to defend
himself effectively. Many timid or disgusted
holders sold out. Mr. Greener gave no sign of
life; but his brokers bought the stock offered for
sale.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length a well-known and talkative broker
confided to an intimate friend, who told his intimate
friend in confidence, who whispered to his
chum, who told, etc., etc., that Mr. John F.
Greener had been responsible for the fall and
rise of Iowa Midland stock; that for months he
had been buying it on the Stock Exchange; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>he had quietly picked up some large blocks in
Iowa. All of which was very sad, and, worse still,
true. Also, that Mr. Greener now held 182,300
shares of the stock, which was even sadder, but
untrue.</p>

<p class='c000'>It really was very well done. The annual meeting
of the company was only six weeks away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reporters rushed to Mr. Greener’s office.
The little financier would not be seen. At length
he reluctantly consented to be interviewed. He
admitted, after a skilful display of unwillingness,
that he had bought Iowa Midland stock. As to
the amount, he said that was not of interest to
the general public. The reporters finally cornered
him and succeeded in making the little
financier say, with a fleeting and very peculiar
smile: “Yes; it <em>is</em> over 100,000 shares.” And
not another word could the newspaper men get
out of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being an intelligent man, he never lied for
publication. Each reporter who saw that smile
and the furtive look that accompanied it went
away convinced to the life-wagering point that
Mr. John F. Greener was in control of the Iowa
Midland. And they wrote accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>President Willetts all but had an apoplectic
stroke. The Street disgustedly said: “Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>successful, villainous plot of Greener’s!” And
such was his reputation as an “absorber” of roads
and roads’ profits that the stock declined ten
points in two days. Investors and speculators
alike displayed a frantic desire not to be identified
in any way or manner with one of Mr. Greener’s
properties.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little financier had not been mistaken. His
last card was his own evil reputation! He had
reserved it for the end. On the wide-spread fear
that followed his broker’s artistic “indiscretion”
he was able to “scoop” 32,000 shares more at
low figures. Such is the value of fame!</p>

<p class='c000'>He now held 110,600 shares, or one third of
the Iowa Midland Railroad Company’s entire
capital stock—enough to coerce Willetts into
making very profitable arrangements with Mr.
Greener’s Keokuk &amp; Northern Railway Company.
Of course the absolute control of the Iowa Midland
was best of all, if it only could be secured.
But of this the sallow-faced little man with the
high forehead and the shifty eyes was doubtful.
He confessed as much to Brown, ending with:
“It’s a shame, too. I could make so much out
of that property!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He estimated—it had cost him $11,000 to secure
the necessary data—that Willetts and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>clique held 105,000 shares, so that there were
still 122,000 shares unaccounted for—probably
scattered among small investors throughout the
country, who did not care who managed the road
so long as they received pleasant promises of
dividends, and also among banking houses and
anti-Greener men, who, though they did not
approve of Willetts, disapproved even more
emphatically and vehemently of Greener and his
methods.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he could not buy the stock itself he must
try to secure proxies.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that some of the trust companies held
a fair amount of the longed-for stock. He laid
siege to them. He bombarded them with promises
and poured an enfilading fire of pledges so
honorable, so eminently sound and business-like,
as to pierce the armor of their distrust. In the
end they actually grew to believe that they were
acting wisely when they pledged their support
to Mr. Greener. The guarantee he gave them
seemed ironclad, and they agreed to give him their
proxies whenever he should send for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He called his clerk Rock and told him: “Go
to the Rural Trust Company and to the Commercial
Loan &amp; Trust Company. See Mr. Roberts
and Mr. Morgan. They will give you some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Iowa Midland proxies made out to Frederick
Rock or John F. Greener.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rock was a good-looking, quiet chap, with a
very well-shaped head and a resolute chin. His
manners were pleasing. He had a habit of looking
one straight in the eyes, but did not always
succeed thereby in conveying an impression of
straightforwardness. But he certainly impressed
one as being bold and keen. His fellow-clerks
used to say that Rock spent his spare time in
studying the financial operations of the Napoleon
of the Street with the same care and minuteness
that military students go over the campaigns of
Napoleon Bonaparte—which was the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Greener,” said Rock, “you are carrying
110,000 shares of stock, are you not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eh?” squeaked Greener, innocently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I figure that, unless you are doing something
outside this office, you will need proxies for 50,000
shares more to give you absolute control and
elect your own board of directors and carry out
your plans in connection with Keokuk &amp; Northern.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Not by so much as the twinkling of an eye did
the little man betray that he was interested in
Rock’s words, or that the clerk’s meddling with
the firm’s affairs was at all out of the ordinary.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“Mr. Greener,” said the clerk, very earnestly,
“I should like to try to get them for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes?” he squeaked, absent-mindedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” answered Rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go ahead, then,” said Mr. Greener, carelessly.
“Let me know next week how you are getting
on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An expression of disappointment came into
Rock’s face, whereupon Greener added: “Of
course if you succeed I’ll do well by you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will you do, Mr. Greener?” asked the
clerk, looking straight at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll give you,” he squeaked, encouragingly,
“ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is that a good price for the work, Mr. Greener?
I may have to pay out a great deal,” added
the young clerk with a faint touch of bitterness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is all that it is worth to me, Mr. Rock, and I
think it is worth more to me than to anybody else.
I’ll raise your salary from sixteen hundred to two
thousand a year. That’s a great deal more money
than I had at your age, Mr. Rock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” said Rock, quietly. “I’ll do the
best I can.” But once away from Greener, his
face flushed with anger and indignation. “Ten
thousand for what might be worth ten millions to
the financier!” The clerk had studied Greener’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Napoleonic methods for two years. He had
learned patience for one thing, and he had waited
for his chance. It had come at last, and he knew
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Events make the man. Rock had thought
carefully, intelligently, and, best of all, coolly.
He had planned logically. It was a good plan;
it was the only feasible plan, and it could not be
upset by meddlesome courts. How Mr. John F.
Greener had failed to think of the same plan was
a bit strange. The unscrupulousness of it did
not frighten the clerk. He had the instincts of a
financier of the Greener school.</p>

<p class='c000'>The clerk all that week did nothing but collect
the Iowa Midland proxies promised by the complaisant
trust companies. They amounted to
21,200 shares. From prominent brokerage houses,
by means of alluring and unauthorized promises,
he secured 7,100 shares; in all he had 28,300
shares. This meant that at the approaching annual
meeting Mr. Greener could vote 138,900
shares out of a possible total of 320,000. Unless
the opposition could unite, the election was already
sure to “go Mr. Greener’s way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From time to time, when the little financier
would ask Rock how he was progressing, the clerk
would tell him he was doing as well as could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>expected. He also told Mr. Greener that the
trust companies had given only 14,000 shares,
and he said nothing whatever of the 7,100 shares
he had secured from the friendly brokers. It
was a desperate risk, this concealing from Mr.
Greener how well he had done; but the clerk
was bold.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moment Rock became convinced that there
were no more pro-Greener proxies to be had by
hook or crook, he began his attack on the enemy.
His problem was to capture the anti-Greener votes—or
stock. He proceeded to put his plan into
effect. And the plan of this healthy clerk with
the unflinching eyes and the resolute chin was
worthy of the sallow-faced little man with the furtive
look and the great forehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a case of <em>heads I win; tails you lose</em>,”
Rock muttered to himself, exultingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man presented himself forthwith at
the office of Weddell, Hopkins &amp; Co., prominent
bankers and bitter enemies of Mr. John F. Greener
and his methods. They knew Rock as one of the
confidential clerks of Brown &amp; Greener, and he
had no difficulty in securing an audience from Mr.
Weddell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning, Mr. Weddell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning, sir,” said the banker, coldly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“I must say I’m somewhat surprised at the presumption
of your people in sending you to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Weddell,” said Rock, a trifle too eagerly
to be artistic, “I’ve left the firm of Brown &amp;
Greener. They were,” he added, youthfully, “too
rascally for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Weddell’s face froze solid. He feared an
application for a position.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye-es?” he said. His voice matched his
face in frigidity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Weddell,” said the young clerk, looking
straight into the old banker’s eyes, “you in common
with other honest men have been wishing you
could prevent Mr. Greener from wrecking the Iowa
Midland. Now, Mr. Weddell,” he went on, eagerly,
as the enthusiasm of the plan grew upon him,
“I know all about Mr. Greener’s plans and resources
and I want you to help me fight him. If
you do we will win, sure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How will you go about it?” asked the old
banker, evasively. He was not certain this was not
some trick of the versatile Mr. John F. Greener.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Greener,” answered young Rock, “has not
control of the property. He has only 110,600
shares. I had access to the books, and I know to
a share.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t wish you to betray an employer’s secrets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>even though he may be my enemy. I do
not care to hear any more.” He was an old-fashioned
banker, was Mr. Weddell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not betraying any secrets. He himself
said he had over 100,000 shares, and all the reporters
jumped at the conclusion that he had
actually a controlling interest. And that is what
he will have, unless you help me. I have proxies
here for 28,300 shares from trust companies and
commission houses. My plan is to get all the
proxies I can from the anti-Greener and the anti-Willetts
stockholders. Then we can make Mr.
Willetts give us pledges in black and white to inaugurate
the much-needed reforms and stop his
policy of extravagance and his costly traffic arrangements.
Willetts will do it to save himself
and the road from falling into Greener’s hands.
But there’s no time to lose, Mr. Weddell.” The
excitement of the game he was playing stimulated
him like wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you?” queried the old banker, meaningly.
“Where do <em>you</em> come in?” The insinuation
was his last weapon. The young man’s was really
the only feasible plan that he could see.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I? It might be, Mr. Weddell, that after the
election I could be appointed assistant secretary
of the company, as an evidence of good faith on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the part of the reform management. I can keep
tabs on them and represent the Weddell-Hopkins
interest. The salary,” he added, with truly artistic
significance, “could be $5,000 a year. I have
been getting just one-half that.” His salary was
exactly $1,600; but why minimize one’s commercial
value?</p>

<p class='c000'>The old banker walked up and down....</p>

<p class='c000'>“By gad, sir, you shall have our proxies,” said
Mr. Weddell, at length.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be well not to let Mr. Greener suspect
this,” added Rock. And the banker agreed
with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Weddell, Hopkins &amp; Co. held 14,000 shares of
Iowa Midland stock, and on the next day Rock
received their proxies. Coming from so well-known,
so notoriously anti-Greener a house, they
served as credentials to him, and he was able to
convince many doubting Thomases. He secured
proxies from practically all the anti-Greener stock
held in the city, as well as in Philadelphia and
Boston.</p>

<p class='c000'>His day-long absences from the office aroused
no suspicions there, since everybody thought he
was working in the interest of Brown &amp; Greener,
including Messrs. Brown &amp; Greener. All told,
the proxies he had secured from Mr. Greener’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>friends and from his foes amounted to 61,830
shares. It was really a remarkable performance.
He felt very proud of it. As to consequences, he
had carefully weighed them. He was working for
Frederick Rock. He was bound to succeed, on
whichever side the coin came down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Greener called him into the private office.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Rock, how about those Iowa Midland
proxies?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have them safe,” answered the clerk, a bit
defiantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How many?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rock pulled out a piece of paper, though he
knew the figures by heart. He said, in a tone he
endeavored to make nonchalant: “I have exactly
61,830 shares.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What? What?” The Napoleon’s voice overflowed
with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rock looked straight into Greener’s shifty brown
eyes. “I said,” he repeated, “that I had proxies
for 61,830 shares.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Greener remembered himself. “I congratulate
you, Mr. Rock, on keeping your word. You
will find I keep mine equally well,” he said in his
normal squeak.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We may as well have an understanding now
as any other time, Mr. Greener.” Rock’s eyes did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>not leave the sallow face of the great railroad
wrecker. He knew he had crossed the Rubicon.
He was fighting for his future, for the prosperity
of his dreams. And he was fighting a giant of
giants. All this the clerk thought; and the
thought braced him wonderfully. He became
self-possessed, discriminating—a Napoleonic bud
about to burst into full bloom.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?” squeaked Mr. Greener,
naïvely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Brown entered. He was just in time to
hear the clerk say: “You have, all told, 110,000
shares of Iowa Midland. President Willetts and
his crowd control about the same amount.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said the sallow-faced little man. His
forehead was moist—barely moist—with perspiration,
but his face was expressionless. His eyes
were less furtive; that was all. He was looking
intently now at the young clerk, for he understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, some of the proxies stand in the name
of Frederick Rock or John F. Greener, but the
greater part in my name alone. I can vote the
entire lot as I please. And whichever side I vote
for will have an absolute majority. Mr. Greener,
I have the naming of the directors, and therefore
of the president of the Iowa Midland. And you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>can’t prevent me; and you can’t touch me; and
you can’t do a d—d thing to me!” he ended, defiantly.
It was nearly all superfluous, inartistic.
But, youth—a defect one overcomes with time!</p>

<p class='c000'>“You infernal scoundrel!” shouted Mr. Brown.
He had a short, thick neck, and anger made his
face dangerously purple.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I secured most of the proxies,” continued
Rock, in a tone that savored slightly of self-defence,
“by assuring Weddell, Hopkins &amp; Co. and their
friends that I would vote against Mr. Greener.”
He paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go ahead, Mr. Rock,” squeaked Mr. Greener;
“don’t be afraid to talk.” The pale little man
with the black beard and the high forehead not
only had a great genius for finance, but possessed
wonderful nerve. His squeak was an inconsistency;
but it served to make him human.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You offered me $10,000 cash and $2,000 a
year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” admitted Mr. Greener, meekly. “How
much do you want?” His look became furtive
again. A great weight had been removed from
his mind. Rock perceived it and became even
more courageous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Weddell, Hopkins &amp; Co. and their friends
want me to vote the Willetts ticket, Mr. Willetts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>having promised to make important reforms. My
reward is to be the position of assistant secretary,
with headquarters in New York, at a salary of
$5,000 a year, to say nothing of the backing of
Weddell, Hopkins &amp; Co.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll do as much and give you $20,000 in cash,”
said Mr. Greener, quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. I want to join the New York Stock
Exchange. I want you to buy me a seat and I
want you to give me some of your business. And
I want you to lend me $50,000 on my note.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Greener, you know what I can do; and
I know what the absolute control of the Iowa Midland
means to you, and what the consolidation with
Keokuk &amp; Northern or the lease of the one by the
other would do for both of them—and for you.
And I want to be your broker. I’ll serve you
faithfully, Mr. Greener.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rock,” squeaked Mr. Greener, “shake hands.
I understand just how you feel about this. I’ll
buy you a seat and I’ll give you all the business I
can, and I’ll lend you $100,000 without any note.
I think I know you now. The seat you shall have
just as soon as it can be bought. My interests
shall be your interests in the future.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve made all the necessary arrangements. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>can buy the seat at a moment’s notice,” said Rock,
calmly, though his heart was beating wildly for
sheer joy of victory. “It will cost $23,000.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell Mr. Simpson to make out my personal
check for $25,000,” piped the Napoleon of the
Street, almost cordially.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Th-thank you very much, Mr. Greener,”
stammered the bold clerk. “The proxies——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, that’s all right,” interrupted Mr. John F.
Greener. “You’ll go to Des Moines with us.
You’re one of us now. I’ve long wanted a man
like you. But, Rock, nowadays, young men are
either gamblers or fools,” he added, with a final
plaintive squeak.</p>

<p class='c000'>A week later Mr. Greener was elected president
of the Iowa Midland Railway Company and Mr.
Rock was elected a member of the New York Stock
Exchange.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE LOST OPPORTUNITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>For many years Daniel Dittenhoeffer had desired
the ruin of John F. Greener. “Dutch Dan,” as
the Street called Dittenhoeffer was a burly man
with very blonde hair, a very red nose and a very
loud voice. Greener was a sallow, swarthy bit of
a man, with black hair and a squeaky voice. He
had furtive brown eyes and a very high forehead;
while Dittenhoeffer had frank blue eyes and the
pugnacious chin and thick neck of a prize fighter.
Both were members of the New York Stock Exchange
but Greener was never seen on the “floor”
after one of his victims lifted him bodily by the
collar and dropped him fifteen feet into a coal
cellar on Exchange Place. He would plan the
wrecks of railroad systems as a measure preliminary
to their absorption, just as a boa constrictor
crushes its victims into pulp the more easily to
swallow them. But the practice, unchecked for
years, had made him nervous and soul-fidgetty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dan spent his days from 10 to 3 on the Stock
Exchange and his nights from 10 to 3 at the
roulette tables or before a faro lay-out. Restless
as the quivering sea and suffering from chronic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>insomnia, he had perforce to satisfy his constitutional
craving for powerful stimulants, but as he
hated delirium tremens he gave himself ceaselessly
big doses of the wine of gambling—it does as
much for the nerves as the very best whiskey. He
would buy or sell 50,000 shares of a stock and
he would bet $50,000 on the turn of a card. On
an occasion he offered to wager a fortune that he
could guess which of two flies that had alit on
a table would be the first to fly away. Greener
found, in the Stock Exchange, the means to a desired
end. Despite innumerable bits of stock jobbing,
he had no exalted opinion, in his heart of
hearts, of stock operations. But Dittenhoeffer
thought the stock market was the court of last
resort, whither financiers should go, when they
were in the right, to get their deserts; and when
they were in the wrong to overcome their deserts by
the brute force of dollars. It was natural that in
their operations in the market the two men should
be as dissimilar as they were in their physical and
temperamental characteristics—Machiavelli and
Richard Cœur-de-Lion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody knew exactly how the enmity between
Greener and Dittenhoeffer began. The “Little
Napoleon of Railroading” had felt toward Dutch
Dan a certain passive hostility for interference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>with sundry stock market deals. But Dan hated
Greener madly, probably for the same reason that
a hawk may have for hating a snake: the instinctive
antipathy of the utterly dissimilar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scores of men had tried to “bust” Greener, but
Greener had grown the richer by their efforts, the
growth of his fortune being proportionate to the
contraction of theirs. Sam Sharpe had come from
Arizona with $12,000,000 avowedly to show the
effete East how to crush “financial skunks of
the Greener class.” And the financial skunk
learned no new lesson, though the privilege of
imagining he was giving one cost Sharpe a half-million
a month for nearly one year. Then, after
Sharpe had learned more of the game—and of
Greener—he joined hands with Dittenhoeffer and
together they attacked Greener. They were skilful
stock operators, very rich and utterly without
financial fear. And they loathed Greener. In a
more gorgeous age they would have cut the Little
Napoleon to pieces and passed his roasted heart
on a platter around the festive board. In the colorless
XIX century they were fain to content
themselves with endeavoring to despoil him of his
tear-stained millions; to do which they united their
own smile-wreathed millions—some seven or eight
of them—and opened fire. Their combined fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>was divided into ten projectiles and one after another
hurled at the little man with the squeaky
voice and the high forehead. The little man
dodged the first and the second and the third, but
the fourth broke his leg and the fifth knocked the
wind out of him. The Street cheered and showed
its confidence in the artillerists by going short of
the Greener stocks. But just before the sixth
shot Greener called to his assistance old Wilbur
Wise, the man with the skin-flinty heart and
thirty millions in cash. A protecting rampart,
man-high, of government bonds was raised about
the prostrate Napoleon and the financial cannoneers
ceased firing precious projectiles. The new
fortifications were impregnable and they knew it;
so they contented themselves with gathering up
their own shot and a small railroad or two dropped
by Greener in his haste to seek shelter. Then
Sharpe went to England to win the Derby and
Dittenhoeffer went to Long Branch to amuse himself
playing a no-limit faro game that cost him
on an average $10,000 a night for a month.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a period of peace in Wall Street following
the last encounter between the diminutive
Napoleon and Dutch Dan. But after a few months
the fight resumed. Greener was desirous of “bulling”
his stocks generally and his pet, Federal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Telegraph Company, particularly. Just to show
there was no need to hurry the “bull” or upward
movement Dan sold the stock “short” every time
Greener tried to advance the price. Four times
did Greener try and four times Dittenhoeffer sold
him a few thousand shares—just enough to check
the advance. Up to a certain point a manipulator
of stocks is successful. His manipulation may
comprise many ingenious and complex actions and
devices, but the elemental fact in bull manipulation
is to buy more than the other fellow can or
wishes to sell. Greener was willing to buy, but Dan
was even more willing to sell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greener really was in desperate straits. He was
committed to many important enterprises. To
carry them out he needed cash and the banks,
fearful of stock market possibilities, were loath to
lend him enough. Besides which, there was the
desire on the part of the banks’ directors to pick
up fine bargains should their refusal to lend
Greener money force him to throw overboard the
greater part of his load. Greener had despoiled
innumerable widows and orphans in his railroad
wrecking schemes. The money lenders should
avenge the widows and orphans. It was a good
deed. There was not a doubt of it in their
minds.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Federal Telegraph, in which Greener’s commitments
were heaviest, had been slowly sinking.
Successful in other quarters of the market, Dutch
Dan decided to “whack the everlasting daylights
out of Fed. Tel.” He went about it calmly, just
as he played roulette—selling it methodically,
ceaselessly, depressingly. And the price wilted.
Greener, unsuccessful in other quarters of the
Street, decided it was time to do something to
save himself. He needed only $5,000,000. At
a pinch $3,000,000 might do; or, for the moment,
even $2,500,000. But he must have the
money at once. Delay meant danger and danger
meant Dittenhoeffer and Dittenhoeffer might
mean death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of a sudden, rising from nowhere, fathered by
no one, the rumor whirled about the Street that
Greener was in difficulties. Financial ghouls ran
to the banks and interviewed the presidents.
They asked no questions in order to get no lies.
They simply said, as though they knew: “Greener
is on his uppers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The bank presidents smiled, indulgently, almost
pityingly: “Oh, you’ve just heard it, have you?
We’ve known it for six weeks!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Back to the Stock Exchange rushed the ghouls
to sell the Greener stocks—not Federal Telegraph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>which was really a good property, but his reorganized
roads, whose renascence was so recent that
they had not grown into full strength. Down
went prices and up went the whisper: “Dittenhoeffer’s
got Greener at last!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A thousand brokers rushed to find their dear
friend Dan to congratulate him—Napoleon’s conqueror,
the hero of the hour, the future dispenser
of liberal commissions, but dear Dan could not
be found. He was not on the “floor” of the Exchange
nor at his office.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some one had sought Dittenhoeffer before the
brokers thought of congratulating him—some one
who was the greatest gambler of all, greater even
than Dutch Dan—a little man with furtive brown
eyes and a squeaky voice; also a wonderful forehead:
Mr. John F. Greener.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Dittenhoeffer, I sent for you to ask you
a question,” he squeaked, calmly. He stood beside
a garrulous ticker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly, Mr. Greener.” And Dittenhoeffer
instantly had a vision of humble requests to “let
up.” And he almost formulated the very words
of a withering refusal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you execute an order from me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly, Mr. Greener. I’ll execute anybody’s
orders. I’m a broker.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Very well. Sell 50,000 shares of Federal
Telegraph Company for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What price?” jotting down the figures, from
force of habit, his mind being paralyzed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The best you can get. The stock,” glancing
at the tape, “is 91.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two men looked at one another—Dutch
Dan half menacingly, Greener, calmly, steadily,
his furtive eyes almost truthful.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning,” said Dittenhoeffer at length
and the little man’s high-browed head nodded dismissingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dittenhoeffer hastened back to the Exchange.
At the entrance he met his partner, Smith—the
“Co.” of D. Dittenhoeffer &amp; Co.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bill, I’ve just got an order from Greener to
sell 50,000 shares of Federal Telegraph.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wh-what?” gasped Smith.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Greener sent for me, asked me whether I’d accept
an order from him, I said yes, and he told me
to sell 50,000 shares of Telegraph, and I’m——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ve got him, Dan. You’ve got him,” exultantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going to cover my 20,000 shares with the
first half of the order and sell the rest the best I
can.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Man alive, this is your chance! Don’t you
see you’ve got him? Smilie of the Eastern National
Bank tells me there isn’t a bank in the city
will lend Greener money, and he needs it badly to
pay the last $10,000,000 to the Indian Pacific
bondholders. He’s bit off more than he can chew,
damn ‘im!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Bill, we’ll treat Mr. Greener as we do
any other customer,” said Dittenhoeffer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—” began Smith, with undisguised consternation;
he was an honest man, when away
from the Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I’ll get him yet. This won’t save him.
I’ll get him yet,” with a confident smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would have been very easy for him to take
advantage of Greener’s order to make a fortune.
He was short 20,000 shares which he had put out
at an average price of 93. He could have taken
Greener’s block of 50,000 shares and hurled it
bodily at the market. Not even a gilt-edge stock
could withstand the impact of such a fearful blow,
and the price of Federal Telegraph doubtless
would have broken 15 points or more, and he
could easily have taken in his shorts at 75 or possibly
even at 70–-which would have meant a
profit of a half-million of dollars—and a loss of
a much needed million to his arch-foe, Greener.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>And if he allowed his partner to whisper in strict
confidence to some friend how Dan was selling out
a big line of Telegraph for Greener the “Room”
would have gone wild and everybody would have
hastened to sell and the decline would have gone
so much further as to cripple the little Napoleon
possibly beyond all hope of recovery. Had
Greener made the most colossal mistake of his
life in giving the order to his enemy?</p>

<p class='c000'>Dan went to the Federal Telegraph post where
a score of madmen were shouting at the top of
their voices the prices they were willing to pay or
to accept for varying amounts of the stock. He
gave to twenty brokers orders to sell 1,000 shares
each at the best obtainable price and he himself,
through another man took an equal amount. On
the next day he in person sold 20,000 shares and
on the third day the last 10,000 shares of Greener’s
order. This selling, the Street thought, was
for his own account. It was all short stock; that
is, his colleagues thought he was selling stock he
didn’t own, trusting later on to buy it back
cheaply. Such selling never has the depressing
effect of “long” stock because it is obvious that
the short seller must sooner or later buy the stock
in, insuring a future demand, which should exert
a lifting influence on prices; for</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“<em>He who sells what isn’t his’n</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Must buy it back or go to pris’n.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Dittenhoeffer was able to get an average
of $86 per share for Greener’s 50,000 shares of
Federal Telegraph Company stock, for the Street
agreed, with many headshakings, that Dan was
becoming too reckless and Greener was a slippery
little cuss and the short interest must be simply
enormous and the danger of a bad “squeeze” exceedingly
great. Wherefore, they forebore to
“whack” Telegraph. Indeed, many shrewd
traders saw, in the seeming weakness of the stock,
a trap of the wily little Napoleon and they
“fooled” him by astutely buying Federal Telegraph!</p>

<p class='c000'>With the $4,300,000 which he received from
the sale of the big block of stock, Greener overcame
his other troubles and carried out all his plans.
It was a daring stroke, to trust to a stock broker’s
professional honor. It made him the owner of a
great railroad system. Dutch Dan’s attacks later
did absolutely no harm. Greener had made an
opportunity and Dittenhoeffer had lost one.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>He was only seventeen, fair-haired and rosy-cheeked,
with girlish blue eyes, when he applied
for the vacancy in the office of Tracy &amp; Middleton,
Bankers and Brokers. His name was Willis
N. Hayward, and he was a proud boy, indeed,
when he was selected out of twenty “applicants”
to be telephone-clerk for the firm.</p>

<p class='c000'>From 10 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.M.</span></span> until 3 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span> he stood by Tracy
&amp; Middleton’s private telephone on the floor of
the Stock Exchange—the Board Room—receiving
messages from the office—chiefly orders to
buy or sell stocks for customers—and transmitting
the same messages to the “Board member” of
the firm, Mr. Middleton; also telephoning Mr.
Middleton’s reports to the office. He spoke with
a soft, refined voice, and his blue eyes beamed so
ingenuously upon the other telephone-boys in the
same row of booths, that they said they had a
Sally in their alley, and they immediately nicknamed
him Sally.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was all very wonderful to young Hayward,
who had been out of boarding-school but a few
months—the excited rushing hither and thither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of worried-looking men, the frantic waving of
hands, the maniacal yelling of the brokers executing
their orders about the various “posts,” and
their sudden relapse into semi-sanity as they jotted
down the price at which they had sold or
bought stocks. It was not surprising that he
should fail to understand just how they did business;
but what most impressed him was the fact,
vouched for by his colleagues, that these same
clamoring, gesticulating brokers were actually
supposed to make a great deal of money. He
heard of “Sam” Sharpe’s $100,000 winnings in
Suburban Trolley, and of “Parson” Black’s famous
million-dollar <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i> in Western Delaware—the little
gray man even being pointed out to him in
corroboration. But, then, he had also heard of
Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, and Jack the
Giant Killer.</p>

<p class='c000'>He learned the business, as nearly all boys
must do in Wall Street, by absorption. If he
asked questions he received replies, but no one
volunteered any information for his guidance, and
in self-defence he was forced to observe closely, to
see how others did, and to remark what came of
it. He heard nothing but <em>speculate! speculate!</em>
in one guise or another, many words for the same
meaning. It was all buying or selling of stocks—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>concentrated and almost visible hope of making
much money in the twinkling of an eye. Nobody
talked of anything else on the Exchange. Bosom
friends met at the opening of business and did not
say “Good-morning,” but plunged without preamble
into the only subject on earth—speculation.
And if one of them arrived late he inevitably
inquired forthwith, “How’s the market?”—asked
it eagerly, anxiously, as if fearful that
the market had taken advantage of his absence
to misconduct itself. The air was almost unbreathable
for the innumerable “tips” to buy or
sell securities and insecurities of all kinds. The
brokers, the customers, the clerks, the Exchange
door-keepers, all Wall Street read the morning
papers, not to ascertain the news, but to pick such
items as would, should, or might, have some effect
on stock values. There was no god but the ticker,
and the brokers were its prophets!</p>

<p class='c000'>All about Sally were hundreds of men who
looked as if they took their thoughts home with
them and dined with them and slept with them and
dreamed of them—the look had become settled, immutable.
And it was not a pleasant look, about
the eyes and lips. He saw everywhere the feverishness
of the “game.” Insensibly the atmosphere of
the place affected him, colored his thoughts, induced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>certain fancies. As he became more familiar with
the technique of the business he grew to believe,
like thousands of youthful or superficial observers,
that stock-market movements were comparable
only to the gyrations of the little ivory ball about
the roulette-wheel. The innumerable tricks of
the trade, the uses of inside misinformation, the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rationale</span></i> of stock-market manipulation, were a
sealed book to him. He heard only that his
eighteen-year-old neighbor made $60 buying
twenty shares of Blue Belt Line on Thursday and
selling them on Saturday, 3⅜ points higher; or
that Micky Welch, Stuart &amp; Stern’s telephone-boy,
had a “tip” from one of the big room traders which
he bravely “played”—as you “play” horse or
“play” the red or the black—and cleared $125 in
less than a week; or that Watson, a “two-dollar”
broker, made a “nice turn” selling Southern
Shore. Or else he heard, punctuated with poignant
oaths, how Charlie Miller, one of the New
Street door-keepers, lost $230 buying Pennsylvania
Central, after he accidentally overheard Archie
Chase, who was “Sam” Sharpe’s principal broker,
tell a friend that the “Old Man” said “Pa.
Cent.” was due for a ten-point rise; instead of
which there had been a seven-point decline. Always
the boy heard about the apparently irresponsible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“bulges” and “drops,” of the winnings
of the men who happened to guess correctly, or
of the losses of those who had failed to “call the
turn.” Even the vernacular of the place savored
of the technicalities of a gambling-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>As time wore on the glamour of the game wore
off; likewise his scruples. His employers and their
customers—all gentlemanly, agreeable people—speculated
every day, and nobody found fault
with them. It was not a sin; it was a regular
business. And so, whenever there was a “good
thing,” he “chipped in” one dollar to a telephone-boys’
“pool” that later operated in a New Street
bucket shop to the extent of ten shares. His
means were small, his salary being only $8 a
week; and very often he thought that if he only
had a little more money he would speculate on a
larger scale and profit proportionately. If each
time he had bought one share he had held twenty
instead, he figured that he would have made no
less than $400 in three months.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time is ripe for other things when a boy
begins to reason that way. Having no scruples
against speculating, the problem with him became
not, “Is it wrong to speculate?” but rather,
“What shall I do to raise money for margin purposes?”
It took nearly four months for him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>arrive at this stage of mind. With many boys
the question is asked and satisfactorily solved
within three weeks. But Hayward was an exceptionally
nice chap.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, the position of telephone-boy is really
important in that it requires not only a quick-witted
but a trustworthy person to fill it. In
the first place, the boy knows whether his firm
is buying or selling certain stocks; he must exercise
discrimination in the matter of awarding the
orders, should the Board member of the firm happen
to be unavailable when the boy receives the
order. For example: International Pipe may be
selling at 108. A man in Tracy &amp; Middleton’s
office, who has bought 500 shares of it at 104,
wishes to “corral” his profits. He gives an order
to the firm to sell the stock, let us say, “at the
market,” that is, at the ruling market price.
Tracy &amp; Middleton immediately telephone over
their private line to the Stock Exchange to their
Board member to “sell 500 shares of International
Pipe at the market.” The telephone-boy
receives the message and “puts up” Mr. Middleton’s
number, which means that on the multicolored,
checkered strip on the frieze of the New
Street wall, Mr. Middleton’s number, 611, appears
by means of an electrical device. The moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Mr. Middleton sees that his number is “up,”
he hastens to the telephone-booth to ascertain what
is wanted. Now, if Mr. Middleton delays in answering
his number the telephone-boy knows he is absent,
and gives the order to a “two-dollar” broker,
like Mr. Browning or Mr. Watson, who always
hover about the booths looking for orders. He
does the same if he knows that Mr. Middleton is
very busy executing some other order, or if, in
his judgment, the order calls for immediate execution.
The two-dollar broker sells the 500 shares
of International Pipe to Allen &amp; Smith, and
“gives up” Tracy &amp; Middleton on the transaction,
that is, he notifies the purchaser that he is
acting for T. &amp; M., and Allen &amp; Smith must look
to the latter firm—the real sellers—for the stock
bought. For this service the broker employed by
Tracy &amp; Middleton receives the sum of $2 for
each 100 shares, while Tracy &amp; Middleton, of
course, charge their customers the regular commission
of one eighth of one per cent., or $12.50
per each hundred shares.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Hayward attended to his business closely,
and when Mr. Middleton was absent from the
floor, or busy, he impartially distributed the firm’s
telephoned buying or selling orders among the
two-dollar brokers, for Tracy &amp; Middleton did a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>very good commission business indeed. He was a
nice-looking and nice-acting little chap, was Hayward—clean-faced,
polite, and amiable. The
brokers liked him, and they “remembered” him at
Christmas. The best memory was possessed by
“Joe” Jacobs, who gave him $25, and insinuated
that he would like to do more of Tracy &amp; Middleton’s
business than he had been getting.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said Sally, “the firm said I was to
give the order to whichever broker I found first.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Jacobs, oleaginously, “I am never
too busy to take orders from such a nice young
fellow as yourself, if you take the trouble to find
me; and I’ll do something nice for you. Look
here,” in a whisper, “if you give me plenty of
business, I’ll give you $5 a week.” And he dived
into the mob that was yelling itself hoarse about
the Gotham Gas post.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hayward’s first impulse was to tell his firm
about it, because he felt vaguely that Jacobs would
not have offered him $5 a week if he had not expected
something dishonorable in return. Before
the market closed, however, he spoke to Willie
Simpson, MacDuff &amp; Wilkinson’s boy, whose telephone
was next to Tracy &amp; Middleton’s. Sure
enough, Willie expressed great indignation at Jacobs’s
action.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“It’s just like that old skunk,” said Willie.
“Five dollars a week, when he can make $100 out
of the firm. Don’t you do it, Sally. Why, Jim
Burr, who had the place before you, used to get
$20 a week from old man Grant and $50 a month
from Wolff. You’ve got a cinch, if you only
know how to work it. Why, they are supposed to
give you fifty cents a hundred.” Willie had been
in the business for two years, and he was a very
well-dressed youth, indeed. Sally now understood
how he managed it on a salary of $12
a week.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not say anything to the firm that day,
nor any other day. And he didn’t say anything
to Jacobs in return, but, by Willie’s sage advice,
contented himself with merely withholding all orders
from that oleaginous personage, until Mr.
Jacobs was moved to remonstrate. And Sally,
who had learned a great deal in a week under
Willie’s tuition, answered curtly: “Business is
very bad; the firm is doing hardly anything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But Watson told me,” said Jacobs, angrily,
“that he was doing a great deal of business for
Tracy &amp; Middleton. I want you to see that I
get my share, or I’ll speak to Middleton and find
out what the trouble is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is that so?” said Sally, calmly. “You might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>also tell Mr. Middleton that you offered me $5 a
week to give you the bulk of our business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most stringent laws of the Stock Exchange
treats of “splitting” commissions. Any
member who, in order to increase his business,
charges an outsider or another member less than
exactly the prescribed amount for buying or selling
stocks, is liable to severe penalties. The offer
of a two-dollar broker to give a telephone-boy
fifty cents for each order of 100 shares secured
was obviously a violation of the rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jacobs came down to business at once. “I’ll
make it $8,” he said, conciliatingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jim Burr, who had the position before me,”
expostulated Sally, indignantly, “told me he received
$25 a week from Mr. Grant, with an extra
$10 thrown in from time to time, when Mr. Grant
made some lucky turn, to say nothing of what the
other men did for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Three months before he could not have made
this speech had his life depended on it. The rapid
development of his character was due exclusively
to the “forcing” power of the atmosphere which
surrounded him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must be crazy,” said Jacobs, angrily.
“Why, I never get much more than a thousand
shares a week from Tracy &amp; Middleton, and usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>less. Say, you ought to be on the floor. You
are wasting your talent in the telephone business,
you are. Let’s swap places, you and I.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“According to our books,” said Sally to the
irate broker, having been duly coached by Mr.
William Simpson, “the last week you did business
for us you did 3,800 shares, and received $76.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was an exceptional week. I’ll make
it $10,” said Jacobs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Twenty-five,” whispered Sally, determinedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let’s split the difference,” murmured Jacobs,
wrathfully. “I’ll give you $15 a week, but you
must see that I get at least 2,500 shares a week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right. I’ll do the best I can for you, Mr.
Jacobs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he did, for the other brokers gave him
only twenty-five cents, or at the most fifty cents
per hundred shares. In the course of a month or
two Sally was in possession of an income of $40 a
week. And he was only eighteen.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>II.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Time-passed. As it had happened with his
predecessor, so did it happen now with Sally. He
began by speculating, wildly at first, more carefully
later on. He met with sundry reverses, but
he also made some very lucky turns indeed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>he was “ahead of the game” by a very fair amount—certainly
a sum far greater than any plodding
clerk could save in five years, greater than many
an industrious mechanic saves in his entire life.
From the bucket-shops he went to the Consolidated
Exchange. Then he asked Jacobs and the
other two-dollar brokers to let him deal in a small
way with them, which they did out of personal
liking for him, until he had three separate accounts
and could “swing a line” of several
hundred shares. He became neither more nor
less than 10,000 other human beings in Wall
Street—moved by the same impulses, actuated
by the same feelings, experiencing the same
emotions, having the same thoughts and the
same views of what they are pleased to call
their “business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the blow fell which Sally had so long
dreaded—he was “promoted” to a clerkship in
Tracy &amp; Middleton’s office. The firm meant to
reward him for his devotion to his work, for his
brightness and quickness. From $15 a week they
raised his salary to $25, which they considered
quite generous, especially in view of his youth,
and that he had started three years before with
$8. He was only twenty now. But Sally, knowing
it meant the abandonment of his lucrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>perquisites as telephone “boy,” bemoaned his undeserved
fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took the money he had made to Mr. Tracy
and told him an interesting story of a rich aunt
and a legacy, and asked him to let him open an
account in the office. Tracy congratulated his
young clerk, took the $6,500, and thereafter Sally
was both an employee and a customer of Tracy &amp;
Middleton.</p>

<p class='c000'>Addicted to sharp practices though Mr. Tracy
was and loving commissions as he did, he nevertheless
sought to curb Sally’s youthful propensity
for “plunging,” which was as near being kind as
it was possible for a stock-broker to be. But the
money had “come easy.” That is why fortunes
won by stock gamblers are lost with apparent
recklessness or stupidity. Sally speculated with
varying success, running up his winnings to $10,000,
and seeing them dwindle later to $6,000.
But in addition to becoming an inveterate speculator,
he gained much valuable experience. And
when he had learned the tricks of the trade he was
taken from the ledgers and turned loose in the
customers’ room, to take the latter’s orders and
keep them in good humor and tell them the current
stories, and give them impressively whispered
“tips,” and “put them into” various “deals” of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the firm, and see that they traded as often as possible,
which meant commissions for the firm. He
became friendly and even familiar with Tracy &amp;
Middleton’s clients, among whom were some very
wealthy men, for a stock-broker’s office is a democratic
place. Men who would not have dreamed
of taking their Wall Street acquaintances to their
homes or to their clubs for a million reasons,
all but called each other by their first names
there.</p>

<p class='c000'>He really was a bright, amiable fellow, very
obliging—he was paid for it by the firm—and
he made the most of his opportunities. The customers
grew to like him exceedingly well, and to
think with respect of his judgment, market-wise.
One day W. Basil Thornton, one of the wealthiest
and boldest customers of the firm, complained
of the difficulty of “beating the game” with the
heavy handicap of the large brokerage commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jestingly, yet hoping to be taken seriously,
Sally said: “Join the New York Stock Exchange
or buy me a seat, and form the firm of Thornton
&amp; Hayward. Just think, Colonel, we would have
your trade, and you could bring some friends, and
I could bring mine, and I think many of these”—pointing
to Tracy &amp; Middleton’s customers—“would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>come over to us. They all think a lot,”
diplomatically, “of your opinions on the market.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thornton was favorably impressed with the
idea, and Sally saw it. From that moment on he
worked hard to gain the Colonel’s confidence. It
was he who gave Thornton the first hint of Tracy
&amp; Middleton’s condition, which led to the withdrawal
of Thornton’s account—and his own—from
the office. It was a violation of confidence and
of business ethics, but Thornton was very grateful
when, two months later, Tracy &amp; Middleton failed,
under circumstances which were far from creditable,
and which were discussed at great length by
the Street. He showed his gratitude by adding
a round sum to Sally’s $11,500, and Willis N.
Hayward became a member of the New York
Stock Exchange. Shortly afterward the firm of
Thornton &amp; Hayward, Bankers and Brokers, was
formed. Sally, then in his twenty-fifth year, had
become a seasoned Wall Street man.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>III.</h3>

<p class='c016'>From the start the new firm did well. Colonel
Thornton and two or three friends who followed
him from Tracy &amp; Middleton’s office, all of them
“plungers,” were almost enough to keep Hayward
busy on the Exchange executing orders, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>moreover, new customers were coming in. Had
he been satisfied with this start, and with letting
time do the rest, he would have fared very well.
But he began to speculate for himself, and all
reputable commission men will tell you, with varying
degrees of emphasis, that this not only “ties
up” the firm’s money, but that no man can
“trade”—speculate—on his own hook and at
the same time do justice to his customers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thornton was a rich man, and protected his
own speculations more than amply. He noticed
the development of his young partner’s gambling
proclivities, and remonstrated with him—in a
kindly, paternal sort of way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sally vowed he would stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within less than three months he had broken
his promise twice, and his unsuccessful operations
in Alabama Coal at one time threatened seriously
to embarrass the firm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Thornton came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sally promised, with a solemnity born of sincere
fear, never to do it again.</p>

<p class='c000'>But fright lasts but a little space, and memory
is equally short-lived. Wall Street has no room
for men with an excess of timidity or of recollection.
He had gambled before he joined the New
York Stock Exchange. After all, if speculating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>were a crime and convictions could be secured in
fifty out of a hundred flagrant instances, one half
the male population of the United States would
perforce consist of penitentiary guards forever engaged
in watching over the convicted other half,
Sally told a customer one day.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, too, Willis N. Hayward, the Board
member of Thornton &amp; Hayward, was a very different
person from Sally, the nice little telephone-boy
of Tracy &amp; Middleton’s. His cheeks were
not pink; they were mottled. His eyes were not
clear and ingenuous; they were shifty and a bit
watery. He had been in Wall Street eight or
ten years, and he overworked his nerves every day
from 10 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.M.</span></span> to 3 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span> on the Stock Exchange;
also from 5 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.M.</span></span> to midnight at the café of a big
up-town hotel, where Wall Street men gathered
to talk shop. His system craved stimulants;
gambling and liquor were the strongest he knew.</p>

<p class='c000'>When, after three years, the firm expired by
limitation, Colonel Thornton withdrew. He had
had enough of Hayward’s plunging. To be sure,
Sally had become a shrewd “trader,” and he had
made $75,000 during the big bull boom; but he
was at heart a “trader,” which is to say, a mere
gambler in stocks, and not a desirable commission
man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>But Sally, flushed with success on the bull side,
did not worry when Thornton refused to continue
the partnership. The slogan was “Buy A.
O. T. It’s sure to go up!” the initial standing
for <em>Any Old Thing</em>! The most prosperous period
in the industrial and commercial history of the
United States begot an epidemic of speculative
madness such as was never before known, and
probably never again will be. Everybody had
money in abundance, and the desire for speculation
in superabundance. Sally formed a new
firm immediately—Hayward &amp; Co.—with his
cashier as partner.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c016'>All mundane things have an end, even bull
markets and bear markets. The bull market saw
Hayward &amp; Co. doing a good business, as did
everybody else in Wall Street. It ended, and the
firm’s customers, after a few bad “slumps” in
prices, were admonished to turn bears in order to
recoup their losses. Bears believe prices are too
high and should go lower; bulls, optimists, believe
the opposite. The public can’t sell stocks
“short” any more than the average man is left-handed.
These customers were no exception, so
they did nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Hayward had “overstayed” the bull market,
though not disastrously; that is, he was in error
regarding the extent and duration of the upward
movement of prices. He proceeded to fall into a
similar error on the bear, or downward, side. The
market had been extremely dull following what
the financial writers called a “severe decline,” but
which meant the loss of millions of dollars by
speculators. A panic had been narrowly averted
by a timely combination of “powerful interests,”
after which the market became professional. In
the absence of complaisant lambs, the financial
cannibals known as “room traders” and “pikers”
tried to “scalp eighths” out of each other for
weeks—to take advantage of fractional fluctuations
instead of waiting for big movements. Hayward’s
customers, like everybody else’s customers,
were not speculating. So he used their money to
protect his own speculations. Office expenses
were numerous and heavy, and commissions few
and light.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hayward was very bearish. He had sold stocks,
sharing the belief of the majority of his fellows,
that the lowest prices had not been reached. As
a result he was heavily “short,” and he could not
“cover” at a profit, because prices had advanced
very slowly, but very steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>One day a big gambler in Chicago, bolder or
keener than his Eastern brethren, thought the
time was ripe for a “bull” or upward movement
in general, and particularly in Consolidated Steel
Rod Company’s stock. He was the chairman of
the board of directors. Mr. William G. Dorr
decided upon a plan whereby the stock would be
made attractive to that class of speculative investors,
so to speak, who liked to buy stocks
making generous disbursements of profits to their
holders. Mr. Dorr’s plan was kept a secret. The
first step consisted of sending in large buying
orders, handled by prominent brokers, and synchronously
the publication, in the daily press, of
various items, all reciting the wonderful prosperity
of the Consolidated Steel Rod Company and its
phenomenal earnings; also the unutterable cheapness
of the stock at the prevailing price. Mr.
Dorr and associates, of course, had previously
taken advantage of the big “slump” or fall in
values to buy back at 35 the same stock they had
sold to the public some weeks before at 70.
Having acquired this cheap stock, they “manipulated”—by
means of further purchase—the
price so that they could sell out at a profit.</p>

<p class='c000'>It so happened, however, that once before
dividend rumors about “Con. Steel Rod” had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>been disseminated, with the connivance of Dorr,
and they had not come true, to the great detriment
of credulous buyers and the greater profit of
the insiders, who were “short” of the stock “up
to their necks”—a typical bit of stock-jobbing
whereat other and more artistic stock-jobbers had
expressed the greatest indignation. Instead of
putting the stock on a dividend-paying basis, the
directors had decided—at the last hour—that it
would not be conservative to do so, whereupon
the stock had “broken” seventeen points. The
lambs lost hundreds of thousands of dollars; the
insiders gained as much. It was a “nice turn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hayward remembered this, and when the stock,
after several days of conspicuous activity and
steady advances, rose to 52, he promptly sold
“short” 5,000 shares—believing that the barefaced
manipulation would not raise the stock much
above that figure, and that before long it must
decline. Only a month previously it had sold at
35 and nobody wanted any of it. He was all the
more decided in his opinion that the “top” had
been reached by prices, because Mr. Dorr, in a
Chicago paper, had stated that the stockholders
would probably receive an entire year’s dividend at
one fell swoop by reason of the unexampled prosperity
in the steel rod trade. Such an action was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>unprecedented. It had been talked about at various
times in connection with other stocks, but it
had never come true. Why should it come true
in this instance?</p>

<p class='c000'>Hayward, familiar with Dorr’s record, promptly
“coppered” his “tip” to buy, banking on Dorr’s
consistent mendacity. But Mr. William G. Dorr,
shrewdest and boldest of all Western stock gamblers,
fooled everybody—he actually told the
truth. That week the directors did exactly as he
had predicted. When a speculator of his calibre
lies he fools only one half—the foolish half—of
the Street. When he tells the truth he deceives
everybody. Before Wall Street could recover
from the shock the price of the stock was up 5
points, which meant that Hayward was out
$25,000 on that deal alone. But, in addition,
the general list was carried upward sympathetically.
The semi-paralyzed bulls regained confidence
as they saw the successful outcome of the
Chicago gambler’s manœuvres in Consolidated
Steel Rod. Money rates and bear hopes fell;
stock values and bull courage rose! Hayward
began “covering” Steel Rod. He “bought in”
5,000 shares, and after he finished he had lost
$26,750 by the deal. He was still “short” about
12,000 shares of other stocks, on which his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“paper” losses, at the last quoted prices, were over
$35,000; but if he tried to buy back such a large
amount of stock in a market so sensitive to any
kind of bull impetus, he would send prices upward
in a jiffy, increasing his own losses very materially.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went to his office that morning in a tremor.
He consulted the cashier, and found he had only
$52,000 at the bank, of which two thirds belonged
to his customers. He was already, morally
speaking, an embezzler. He was ruined if he
didn’t cover, and he was ruined if he did. His
“seat” on the Stock Exchange was worth possibly
$40,000, not a cent more; and as he personally
owed his out-of-town correspondents nearly $38,000,
he could not avoid being hopelessly ruined.
Moreover, his bankruptcy would not be an
“honest” failure, for, as he told himself bitterly,
after the harm was done, “I had no business to
speculate on my own hook with other people’s
money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had felt it rather than had seen it coming,
for, gambler-like, he had closed his eyes and had
buried his head in the sand of hope, trusting in
luck to protect him from punishment. But now
he was face to face with the question that every
gambler dreads: “If I stood to lose all, how
desperate a risk would I take in order to get it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>back?” The answer is usually so appallingly
thief-like that the numerous Haywards of the
Stock Exchange and the Board of Trade forthwith
stop thinking with a suddenness that does
credit to the remnants of their honesty. But it
haunts them, does the ominous question and the
commenced but unfinished answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he left his office to go to the “Board
Room” he put to himself the fateful query. But
he would not let himself answer it until he had
stopped at “Fred’s,” the official barroom of the
Stock Exchange, and had taken a stiff drink of
raw whiskey. Then the answer came.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was ruined anyhow. If he failed without
further ado, that is, without increasing his liabilities,
he would be cursed by twenty-five of his
customers and by fifteen of his fellow-brokers who
were “lending” stocks to him. But if he made
one last desperate effort, he might pull out of the
hole; or, at the worst, why, the number of cursing
customers would remain the same, but the
fellow-brokers would rise to twenty or thirty.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took another stiff drink. The market had
become undoubtedly a bull market. The bears
had been fighting the advance, and there still remained
a stubborn short interest in certain stocks,
as, for example, in American Sugar Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>stock. Now if that short interest could be
stampeded it might mean an eight or ten-point
advance. If he bought 10,000 or 15,000 shares
and sold them at an average profit of four or five
points, he would put off the disaster, and if he
made ten points he would be a great operator.
He had, to be sure, no business to buy even 1,000
shares of Sugar; but then he had no business to
be on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The liquor was potent. Sally said to himself,
aggrievedly: “I might as well be hung for a flock
as for one measly old mutton.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He walked a trifle unsteadily from “Fred’s”
across the narrow asphalted New Street to the
Stock Exchange. He paused at the entrance.
There was no escape. Unless he could make a
lucky strike, he would fail ignominiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pike’s Peak or bust!” he muttered to himself,
and walked into the big room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning, Mr. Hayward,” said the doorkeeper.
Hayward nodded absently, caught himself
repeating, “Pike’s Peak or bust!” and walked
straight toward the Sugar post.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began to bid for stock. One thousand
shares at 116; he got it. Another thousand; it
was forthcoming at 116⅛. A third thousand;
somebody was glad to sell it at 116½. So far, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>bad. Then he bid 117 for 2,500 shares, and it
was promptly sold. But when he bid “117 for
any part of 5,000!” the crowd hesitated; the
brokers were not altogether sure Hayward was
“good for it”; his ability to pay for the stock
was not undoubted. So Sally, taking advantage
of the hesitation, bid 117¼ and 117½ for 5,000
Sugar, at which price “Billy” Thatcher, a two-dollar
broker, sold it to him. It made 10,500
shares Hayward had bought, and the stock had
risen only 1½ points. The shorts were not frightened
a wee bit. But Sally was. He rushed out
of the crowd to his telephone and made a pretence
of “reporting” the transactions to his office, as
he would have done had they been <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> purchases.
He was followed by a hundred sharply curious—and
curiously sharp—eyes. They saw him
hold the telephone receiver to his ear with an expression
of great interest, as if he were listening
to an important message. But the only message
he heard was that of his heart-beats, that seemed
to say, almost articulately: “You have played
and you have lost; you have played and you have
lost. Therefore, you are that much worse off than
before. You must play again—<em>and not lose</em>!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He left his telephone and rushed back to the
Sugar crowd. He was less excited, less like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>drunken man; his face was no longer flushed, but
pale. And anon there flashed upon him, as if in
candent letters, the words <em>Pike’s Peak or bust</em>!
But <em>Pike’s Peak</em> glowed dully, feebly, while the
alternative was of a lurid splendor. And he
blinked his eyes and made a curious impatient
motion with his hand, as one waves away an annoying
insect.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave an order for 5,000 Sugar to his friend,
Newton Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is this for yourself, Sally?” asked Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. It’s for one of the biggest men in the
Street, Newt. It’s all right. Absolutely O. K.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And thus reassured, Hartley bought the stock.
The price was 118. The seller would hold Hartley
responsible for the purchase money if Hayward
“laid down”—refused to pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sally wiped his forehead twice, quite unnecessarily.
The shorts were not stampeding. Any
attempt to sell out the 15,000 shares he had
bought would result only in depressing the price,
five points at least. It was worse than bad, the
outlook for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave another order to buy 5,000 shares to
“Billy” Lansing, an old and reliable two-dollar
broker, but Lansing declined it. He tried another,
but the order was not accepted. They mistrusted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>him; but he could not even bluster, for
they excused themselves on the ground of having
important orders elsewhere. So he had recourse
to another personal friend—J. G. Thompson.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Joe, buy 5,000 Sugar.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sober?” said Thompson, seriously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See for yourself,” answered Sally, laughingly.
He had nerve. “Old man, I’ve got a very big
order from one of the biggest men in the Street.
Some important developments are going on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sally, are you sure you’ve got an order from
some one else?” asked the unconvinced broker.
His incredulity was obviously in the nature of an
insult, but it was pardonable, for there was too
much at stake.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Joe, come over to the office and I’ll show you.—Really,
I can’t tell you. But I can advise you, as
a friend, to buy Sugar for all you are worth.”
And as he uttered the lie he looked straight into
Thompson’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hayward, are you sure? Are you sure you’re
not making a mistake?” He wanted the commission
of $100, but he did not feel certain of his
friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, hell, no. I’ve got a lot more to buy.
It’s all right. Go ahead, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Joe went ahead. He bought the 5,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>shares. The stock rose to 119½, and Hayward,
warned by his experience with Hartley and Thompson,
did not ask either friend or foe to buy another
5,000 shares for him. What he did was to distribute
buying orders for 10,000 shares in lots of
500. Brokers now accepted his orders, for they
were not so large as to be dangerous. And the
stock rose to 122¾. A few shorts were frightened.
He might win out after all; he might make Pike’s
Peak. He began to bid up the stock. He even
bought “cash” stock, that is, stock for which he
paid cash, had to pay cash outright, receiving the
certificates forthwith, presumably to hand over to
some investor of millions. Everybody on the
“floor” was talking about Hayward. The entire
market had risen in sympathy with Sugar.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at 124 it seemed as if the entire capital
stock was for sale. He ceased buying. He had
accumulated 38,000 shares. To pay for the
stock necessitated about six and one-half millions!
But if he could unload on an average
of only 122 he might “come out even” in his
other troubles.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave an order to sell 10,000 shares to a
broker to whom he had always been a good friend.
It was a fatal mistake. The broker, Louis W.
Wechsler, had previously sold 1,000 shares to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Hayward for “cash” at 122. He suspected what
was coming, and declining the order, he himself
went to Hayward’s office and asked for a check.
The cashier sought to put him off with excuses,
and Wechsler now being certain of the true state
of affairs, returned to the Board and began to sell
Sugar short for his own account. If a crash came
he would make instead of losing it. Hayward
was sure to be ruined, and Wechsler told himself
sophistically that he was only profiting by the inevitable.
In the meantime Sally had sold the
10,000 shares through another broker, and the
price had declined to 121¾. But Wechsler’s
5,000 shares put it down to 120½. And somebody
else sold more, and the shorts recovered from
their fright, and the fatal hour was approaching
when Hayward would have to settle. Pike’s Peak
or bust! He did, indeed, need a veritable Pike’s
Peak of dollars to pay for the 28,000 Sugar he
had on hand. So he busted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He threw up his hands. He acknowledged defeat
to himself. The tension was over. He was
no longer excited, but cool, almost cynical. On
one of the little slips of paper on which brokers
jot down memoranda of their transactions he scribbled
a message in lead pencil. It was his last
official lie, and would cost Hartley and Thompson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and other friends, as well as his customers, many
thousands of dollars. It was as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Owing to the refusal of their bank to extend
the usual facilities to them, Hayward &amp; Co. are
compelled to announce their suspension.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Boy!” he yelled. And he gave the bit of
paper to one of the Exchange messenger boys in
gray. “Take this to the Chairman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he walked slowly, almost swaggeringly, out
of the New York Stock Exchange—for the last
time—as the Chairman pounded with his gavel
until the usual crowd gathered about the rostrum,
and listened to the announcement of the failure of
“Sally” Hayward, who began as a nice little telephone-boy
and ended as a stock-gambler.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>A THEOLOGICAL TIPSTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>At first Wall Street thought that Silas Shaw’s
“religiousness” was an affectation. What purpose
the Old Man desired to serve by the calculated
notoriety of his church affiliations no one
could tell. It is true that many ingenious theories
were advanced, some going so far as to hint
at repentance. But deep in the hearts of his fellow-brokers,
and of his friends and his victims alike,
was the belief that old Shaw, in some not generally
known way, made practical use of his ostentatious
enthusiasm for things churchly as politicians
resort to more or less obvious devices to
“capture the German vote” or to “please the
Irish element.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, after a series of skirmishes and a final
pitched battle in “South Shore” between the Old
Man and the bears, when the pelts of the latter,
after the capitulation, added nearly a half million
to the old fellow’s bank account, certain luminaries
of the Methodist Episcopal Church were called into
consultation. Silas Shaw had long thought about
it; and now there was much conferring and more
or less arid and misplaced sermonizing by the theologians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and much soothing talk by the Old Man’s
lawyers; and more Methodist clergymen and more
lawyers and more talk; and then a real estate
agent and an architect and a leading banker and,
at last, just one check from the Old Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day the newspapers announced that
the Shaw Theological Seminary had been founded
and endowed by Mr. Silas Shaw. But even after
the Old Man had devoted his ursine spoils to this
praiseworthy object, Wall Street continued skeptical.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, yet, Wall Street made a mistake—as it
often does in its judgment of its leaders. Silas
Shaw really had a soft spot in his tape-wound and
ticker-dented old heart for all things ecclesiastical.
Next to being a power in the Street he loved to
be regarded as one of the pillars of his church.
He heard with pleasure, of week days, the wakeful
<em>staccato</em> sound of the ticker; but on Sundays he
certainly enjoyed the soothing cadences of familiar
hymns. And if more than one hardened broker
expressed picturesque but unreproducible opinions
of the old man, so also more than one enthusiastic
young minister could tell pleasant stories of how
the old stock gambler received him and responded
to the fervent appeal for the funds wherewith
many a little backwoods church was built.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Shaw’s generosity was so notorious among the
church people that the Reverend Doctor Ramsdell,
pastor of the Steenth Street Methodist Episcopal
Church and a trustee of the Shaw Theological
Seminary, felt no embarrassment in applying to
him for assistance. It was not Shaw’s church,
but in Dr. Ramsdell’s charge there were one or
two bankers well known in Wall Street and several
members of the New York Stock Exchange.
It seemed particularly fitting to the Rev. Dr.
Ramsdell that the name of Silas Shaw, followed
by a few figures, should head a subscription list.
It was desired to erect a Protestant Chapel in
Oruro, Bolivia—the most uncivilized of all the
South American “republics.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning, Brother Shaw; I trust you
are well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tolerable, tolerable, thank’ee kindly,” replied
the sturdy old gambler. “What brings you
down to this sinful section? Doing some missionary
work, eh? I wish you’d begin among
those da—er—dandy young bears.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, yes,” said the Rev. Dr. Ramsdell, eagerly.
“It is precisely <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</span></i> of missionary work.” And
he told Silas Shaw all about the plan for carrying
the light into Bolivia by building the only Protestant
chapel in Oruro, where it was incredibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>tenebrous—worse than darkest Africa. The reverend
doctor hoped, nay, he knew, in view of
Brother Shaw’s well-known devotion to the glorious
work of redeeming their benighted Bolivian
brethren, that he could count upon him, etc.; and
the subscription list——</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear Dr. Ramsdell,” interrupted Shaw,
“I never sign subscription lists. When I give, I
give; and I don’t want everybody to know how
much I’ve given.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Brother Shaw, you need not sign your
name. I’ll put you down as X. Y. Z.,” he smiled
encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no; don’t put me down at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The good doctor looked so surprised and so woebegone
that Shaw laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cheer up, Doctor. I tell you what I’ll do;
I’ll buy some Erie for you. Yes, sirree; that’s
the best thing I can do. What do you say to
that?” And he looked at the doctor, triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahem!—I am not—are you sure it will
prove a—ahem!—a desirable investment? You
see, I do not—ah—know much about Wall
Street.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Neither do I. And the older I grow the less
I know.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>The reverend doctor ventured a tentative smile
of semi-incredulity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s right, Doctor. But we’ll make something
for you. The blooming, I mean, benighted
Bohemians——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahem!—Bolivians, Brother Shaw.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I meant Bolivians. They must have a chance
for their souls. John,” to a clerk; “buy 500
shares of Erie at the market.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” said John, disappearing into the
telephone booth. To buy, “at the market”
meant to buy at the prevailing or market price.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brother Shaw, I am extremely grateful to you.
This matter is very close to my heart, I assure
you. And—ah—will—when will I know if the—ah—investment
turns out profitably?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, have no fears on that score. We shall
make the stock market contribute to your missionary
fund. All you’ll have to do is to look on
the financial page of your paper every evening and
keep posted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I fear, Brother Shaw,” said Dr. Ramsdell, deprecatingly,
“that I shall have no little trouble
in—ah—keeping posted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not at all. See, here,” and he took up his paper
and turned to the stock tables. “Draw up
your chair, Doctor. You see, here is Erie. Yesterday,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>on transactions of 18,230 shares, Erie Railroad
stock sold as high as 64¾ and as low as 63¼,
the last or closing sale being at 64½. The numbers
mean dollars per share. It was very strong.
Haven’t you got a report on that 500 Erie yet,
John?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” said John. “Sixty-five and one-eighth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, Doctor, the stock is still going up.
Well, every day when you look on the table you
will see at what price Erie stock is selling. If it
is more than 65⅛, why, that will show you are
making money. Every point up, that is, every
unit, will mean that your missionary fund is $500
richer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And—Brother Shaw—ahem!—if it should
be—ah—less?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the use of thinking such things, Dr.
Ramsdell? All you have to remember is that I am
going to make some money for you; and that I
paid 65⅛ for the stock I bought.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You really think——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have no fears, Doctor. You understand, of
course, that it is well not to give such matters
undue publicity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course, of course,” assented the doctor.
“I understand.” But he did not.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Nothing more, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; I thank you very much, Brother Shaw.
I—er—most sincerely hope my—ah—your—I
should say—ah—our investment, may result
in—ah—favorably for our Bolivian Missionary
Fund. Thanks very much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t mention it, Doctor. And don’t you
worry. We will come out O.K. You’ll hear
from me in a week or two. Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The reverend doctor went across the Street to
the office of one of his parishioners, Walter H.
Cranston, a stock broker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Cranston was bemoaning the appalling lack
of business and making up his mind about certain
Delphic advice he contemplated giving his timid
customers, in order to make them “trade,” which
would mean commissions, when Dr. Ramsdell’s
card was brought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Confound him, what does he want to come
around, bothering a man at his business for?” he
thought. But he said: “Show him in, William.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning, Brother Cranston.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, good-morning, Dr. Ramsdell. To what
do I owe this unexpected pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve called to see you about our Missionary
Fund. You know I take a great deal of interest
in it. We desire to build a chapel in Bolivia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>where the light is needed, Brother Cranston, as
much as in China, I assure you. And it is so
much nearer home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Doctor, I really—” began Cranston, with an
injured air.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want your valuable autograph to head the
subscription list,” said the clergyman with an air
he endeavored to make arch and playful. “Don’t
refuse me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why don’t you try some well-known person?”
said Cranston, modestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To tell you the truth, Brother Cranston, I did
try Silas Shaw.” And he added, hastily, “Not
but that you are sufficiently well-known for my
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did the old ras—the Old Man say?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said he never signed subscription lists.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Didn’t he give you anything at all?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes; he—er—he did something for
me.” The doctor’s face assumed a portentous air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cranston’s eyes brightened. “What was that?”
he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said the clergyman, hesitatingly, “he
said we would come out O.K. Those are his own
words, Brother Cranston.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes?” Cranston’s face did not look promising
for Bolivian enlightenment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Yes. He—er—told me he would make the
stock market contribute to the fund.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” Cranston showed a lively interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. I suppose since you are in the same
business, there is no harm in telling you that he
bought some stock for me. Five hundred shares,
it was. Do you think, Brother Cranston, that that—er—that
will mean much? You see, I have the
fund very close to my heart; that is why I ask.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It depends,” said Cranston, very carelessly,
“upon what stock he bought for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was Erie Railroad stock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course, Dr. Ramsdell, your profits will depend
upon the price you paid.” This also in a
tone of utter indifference.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was Brother Shaw who paid. The price
was 65⅛.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aha!” said Cranston. “So the Old Man is
bullish on Erie, is he?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not know what you mean, but I know
he told me I should read the paper every day and
see how much above 65⅛ the price went; and that
I would surely hear from him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I sincerely hope you will, Doctor. Let me
see, will $100 do? Very well, I’ll make out a
check for you. Here it is. And now, Doctor,
will you excuse me? We are very busy, indeed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Good-morning, Dr. Ramsdell. Call again any
time you happen to be down this way.” And he
almost pushed the good man out of the office in
his eagerness to be rid of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner had the ground-glass door closed on
the Rev. Dr. Ramsdell than Cranston rushed to
the telephone and put in an order to buy 1,000
shares of Erie at the best possible price. By doing
this before he notified his friends he proved that
he himself firmly believed in Erie; also, he bought
his stock ahead of theirs and thereby, in all likelihood,
bought it cheaper. He then rushed into
the customers’ room and yelled: “Hi, there!
Everybody get aboard Erie! Silas Shaw is bullish
as Old Nick on it. I get this absolutely
straight. I’ve thought all along the old rascal
was quietly picking it up. It’s his movement and
no mistake. There ought to be ten points in it
if you buy now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The firm of Cranston &amp; Melville bought in all,
that day, for themselves and their customers, 6,200
shares of Erie, doing as much as anyone else to
advance the price to 66½.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that week the reverend doctor was busy
collecting subscriptions for the Bolivian Missionary
Fund. He was a good soul and an enthusiast on
the subject of that particular subscription list.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>So, he told his parishioners how Brother Cranston
had given $100 and Brother Baker, another Wall
Street man, $250, and Brother Shaw had promised—he
told this with an amused smile, as if at
the incongruity of it—to make the stock market
contribute to the fund! Brother Shaw had done
this by buying some stock for him and had assured
him, in his picturesque way, that it would
come out O.K. in a week or two. Everybody to
whom he told that fact developed curiosity regarding
the name of the stock itself. They
showed it in divers ways, according to their various
temperaments. And as he had told some he
felt that he should not discriminate against others;
so, he told to all, impartially, the name of
the stock. It would not harm Brother Shaw, he
supposed—and he supposed rightly. He experienced,
in a gentle, benevolent, half-unconscious sort
of way, something akin to the great Wall Street
delight—that of “giving a straight tip” to appreciative
friends. The Bolivian Missionary Fund
grew even beyond the good man’s optimistic expectations.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a strange, a very strange thing happened:
Erie stock, according to the doctor’s daily perusal
of the dry financial pages, had been fluctuating
between 65 and 67. On the following Tuesday,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to his intense surprise, the stock table recorded:
“Highest, 65¾; lowest, 62; last, 62⅝.” On
Wednesday the table read: “Highest, 62½; lowest,
58; last 58.” On Thursday, there was a ray
of hope—the stock sold as high as 60 and closed
at 59½. But on Friday there was a bad break
and Erie touched 54⅛, just 11⅛ points below what
the Bolivian Missionary Fund’s stock had cost.
And, on Saturday, the stock declined to 50, closing
at 51¼.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Sunday the Reverend Doctor Henry W.
Ramsdell preached to the gloomiest congregation
in Gotham. Wherever he turned his gaze he met
reproachful looks—accusing eyes, full of bitterness
or of anger or of sadness. An exception was Mr.
Silas Shaw, who had come, as he often did, to hear
his friend, Dr. Ramsdell, preach. His eyes beamed
benignantly on the pastor throughout the long
sermon. He looked as if he felt, Dr. Ramsdell
thought, inexplicably contented. Had he forgotten
his promise—the promise from which benighted
Bolivia expected so much?</p>

<p class='c000'>The two men met after the service. Dr. Ramsdell’s
manner was constrained; Mr. Shaw’s affable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-morning, Doctor,” said the grizzled old
operator. “I’ve carried a small piece of paper in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>my pocket for some days, in the hope of meeting
you. Here it is.” And he handed a check for
$5,000 to the clergyman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why—er—I—er—I—didn’t—the stock—er—go
down?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How is it then that——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, that’s all right. It came out just as I
expected. That’s why you get the check.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—ahem!—didn’t you buy 500 shares for
me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; but after you left I sold 10,000 shares
between 65 and 67. Your congregation, Doctor,
developed a remarkable bullishness on Erie.” He
chuckled gleefully. “It was to them that I sold
the stock!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But my—ahem!—impression was that you
said the stock would go up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no. I never said that. I merely told
you we’d come out O.K. And I guess we have.”
He laughed joyously. “It’s all right, Doctor;
those pesky Bolivians will be enlightened, you
bet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said the doctor, with a very red face,
fingering the check, hesitatingly, “I don’t know
whether to accept it or not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, you’re not robbing me,” the old stock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>gambler assured him, gaily. “I made out quite
well; quite well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I—I—mean—” stammered the clergyman,
“I don’t know whether it is right to——”</p>

<p class='c000'>Shaw frowned. “Put that check in your pocket,”
he said, sharply. “You earned it.”</p>

    <div><em>Anthony Hope’s New Novel</em></div>
    <div class='c004'>TRISTRAM OF BLENT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'>It is always a question what Anthony Hope will do
next. From a dashing romance of an imaginary
kingdom to drawing-room repartee is a leap which
this versatile writer performs with the greatest ease. In
his “Tristram of Blent” he has made a new departure,
demonstrating his ability to depict character by some
exceedingly delicate and skillful delineation. The plot
is unique, and is based upon the difference of time of the
Russian and English calendars, by which a marriage, a
birth, and the ownership of lands and name are in turn
affected, producing complications which hurry the reader
on in search of the satisfactory solution which awaits
him. The Tristrams are characters of strong individualities,
of eccentricities likewise. These, coloring all
their acts, leave the reader in doubt as to the issue; yet
it is a logical story through and through, events following
events in carefully planned sequence. A work of undoubted
originality based on modern conditions, “Tristram
of Blent” proves that the author does not need an
ideal kingdom to write a thrilling romance. (12mo, $1.50.)</p>

    <div>IRISH PASTORALS</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>By Shan F. Bullock</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'>“Irish Pastorals” is a collection of character
sketches of the soil—of the Irish soil—by one who
has lived long and closely among the laboring, farming
peasantry of Ireland. It is not, however, a dreary recital
of long days of toil with scanty food and no recreation,
but it depicts within a life more strenuous than
one can easily realize, abundant elements of keen native
wit and irrepressible good nature. The book will give
many American readers a new conception of Irish pastoral
life, and a fuller appreciation of the conditions which
go to form the strength and gentleness of the Irish character.

    <div>THE WESTERNERS</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>By Stewart Edward White</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'>When the Black Hills were discovered to be rich
in valuable ores, there began that heterogeneous
influx of human beings which always follows new-found
wealth. In this land and in this period, Stewart Edward
White has laid the setting of “The Westerners,” a story
which is full of excitement, beauty, pathos and humor.
A young girl, growing to womanhood in a rough mining
camp, is one of the central figures of the plot. The other
is a half-breed, a capricious yet cool, resourceful rascal,
ever occupied in schemes of revenge. Around these two
are grouped the interesting characters which gave color
to that rude life, and, back of them all, rough nature in
her pristine beauty. The plot is strong, logical, and well
sustained; the characters are keenly drawn; the details
cleverly written. Taken all in all, “The Westerners” is
a thoroughly good story of the far West in its most picturesque
decade. (12mo, $1.50.)</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY BREAD ALONE</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>By I. K. Friedman</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'>Mr. Friedman has chosen a great theme for his
new novel, one which affords a wealth of color
and a wide field for bold delineation. It is a story of the
steel-workers which introduces the reader to various and
little-known aspects of those toiling lives. In the course
of the work occurs a vivid description of a great strike.
The author, however, shows no tinge of prejudice, but
depicts a bitter labor struggle with admirable impartiality.
Along with the portrayal of some of man’s worst passions
is that of his best, his affection for woman, forming a
love-story which softens the stern picture. The book
will appeal to students of industrial tendencies, as well
as to every lover of good fiction. (12mo, $1.50.)</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'><em>Here are two volumes of most thrilling tales, gleaned

    <div>WALL STREET STORIES</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>By Edwin Lefèvre</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'>It would be difficult to find a better setting for a good
story than this hotbed of speculation. On the Exchange,
every day is a day of excitement, replete with
dangerous risks, narrow escapes, victories, defeats. There
are rascals, “Napoleonic” rascals, and the “lambs”
who are shorn; there is the old fight between right and
wrong, and sometimes the right wins, and sometimes—as
the world goes—the wrong. In the maddening whirl
of this life, which he knows so well, Edwin Lefèvre has
laid the setting of his Wall Street stories. A number of
them have already appeared in <cite>McClure’s Magazine</cite>, and
their well-merited success is the cause of publication in
book form of this absorbing collection. (12mo, $1.25.)</p>

    <div>HELD FOR ORDERS</div>
    <div class='c004'>STORIES OF RAILROAD LIFE</div>
    <div class='c004'><em>By Frank H. Spearman</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c000'>While railroad life affords fewer elements of passion
and emotion than the life of Wall Street, it
offers however a far greater field for the depiction of
the heroic. Deeds of bravery are probably more common
among these hardy, cool, resourceful men—the railroad
employees—than among any other members of
society. “Held For Orders” describes thrilling incidents
in the management of a mountain division in the far West.
The stories are all independent, but have characters in
common, many of whom have been met with in <cite>McClure’s
Magazine</cite>. Mr. Spearman combines the qualities of a
practical railroad man with those of a fascinating storyteller,
and his tales, both in subject and manner of telling,
are something new in literature. (12mo, $1.50.)</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
